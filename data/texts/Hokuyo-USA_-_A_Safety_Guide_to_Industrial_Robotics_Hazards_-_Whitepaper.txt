According to the World Robotics 2021  Reports by the 
International Federation of Robotics (IFR), global robot 
installations have significantly increased, even during the 
pandemic. Currently, there are over 3 million industrial 
robots operating worldwide, and this number is expected 
to continue to grow. 
Despite their numerous benefits, industrial robots present their own set of challenges, 
especially when it comes to safety issues. These machines are powerful and intelligent, but they 
can also lead to serious accidents, making it crucial to address the risks, hazards, and safety 
standards associated with them. By prioritizing safety and adhering to industry standards, 
we can ensure that the benefits of industrial robotics are realized while minimizing potential 
hazards and risks. 
This whitepaper offers an in-depth exploration of the fundamentals of industrial robotics and 
aims to provide a comprehensive safety guide for addressing hazards and mitigating risks 
associated with these machines.
With the rapid growth of technology, industrial robotics 
is becoming increasingly popular in the market. 
These robots are being utilized to automate industrial 
processes, which is resulting in a significant increase in 
productivity. Moreover, they are capable of performing 
various tasks in different industrial settings, which has 
further boosted their demand. As a result, the robotics 
industry has seen a positive surge in recent years.A SAFETY GUIDE TO INDUSTRIAL ROBOTICS HAZARDS
By 2027, it is 
predicted that the 
industrial robotics 
market will reachUSD 30.8 
million\n2Industrial robots are versatile machines that have revolutionized the industrial sector. These 
robots are programmable and can execute various tasks in different industrial settings, such as 
manufacturing, logistics, agriculture, and healthcare. They can perform various operations that 
are hazardous or require precision, such as welding, painting, and assembly.
As the industrial sector requires repetitive and time-consuming tasks, industrial robots offer a cost-
effective and efficient solution. Moreover, industrial robots can work in extreme temperatures, 
high-pressure environments, and hazardous areas where human workers cannot operate safely.
The increasing demand for industrial robots has led to technological advancements, resulting in 
collaborative robots (cobots) that can work alongside human workers. These cobots are designed 
to share the workspace with humans and can be programmed to assist workers in various tasks, 
improving safety and productivity.What are
Industrial Robots?
Industrial robots have also become more accessible to small and medium-
sized enterprises (SMEs) as the cost of industrial robots has decreased, and the 
installation process has become more straightforward. As a result, SMEs can now 
adopt automation and enhance their productivity and efficiency.\n3
As industrial robots are equipped with sophisticated sensors and better control technologies, 
they are used for a wide range of applications across different industries. The two main reasons 
industries have started using robots at a large scale are efficiency and safety.The Exponential Rise in the 
Use of Industrial Robotics
Robots are capable of carrying out tedious and 
hazardous operations with consistent efficiency 24/7 .
These intelligent automated machineries can replace manual processes that otherwise put 
human lives at risk. Besides, they can also execute tasks in coordination with humans, simplifying 
industrial operations and maximizing throughput at reduced time and risks.
The COVID-19 pandemic is another major factor that triggered the extensive adoption of industrial 
robots in the last few years. Since factory operations were largely affected due to the imposed 
movement restrictions, the industrial sector suffered extensive losses. The virus outbreak 
universally highlighted the demand for automation and backups.\n4
Minimize hazard exposure
Human workers operate in difficult conditions in factories. There can be 
extreme atmospheric conditions like high temperature and pressure 
or freezing conditions depending upon the operational requirements. 
However, humans do not have the ability to cope with extreme weather 
conditions. Besides, as industrial operations expose them to toxic 
chemicals and fumes, these can adversely affect the workers’ health.
Robots, on the contrary, can work in adverse conditions 24/7. Moreover, 
they can operate in extreme environments with high precision. Thus, 
workers’ health risks can be eliminated if industries automate risky 
processes through robots.Industrial robots are designed to undertake human tasks and perform them more efficiently. They 
have faster processing speed and can handle complex tasks without any errors. These robots 
have actuators and servo motors that generate tremendous forces for heavy lift operations. They 
also have vision systems and sensors to help them operate precisely, quickly, and accurately.
Here’s how industrial robots improve safety at the industrial workplace setup:Do Industrial Robots Improve 
Workplace Safety?
\n5Reducing the risk of injuries
Industrial work processes include several routine tasks performed 
repetitively. Workers often require lifting weights and are under constant 
muscle stress. These strenuous activities can cause sprains, back pains, 
and other muscle damage. Besides, even a minor accident, like a collision, 
can lead to severe injuries.
Industrial robots can perform these repetitive tasks without any failure. 
They have well-designed control mechanisms that help them operate 
efficiently and carry out strenuous jobs efficiently, limiting the risk of 
injuries to human workers.
Operational safety
Industrial robots can help increase awareness of workplace safety. The 
embedded sensors in these robots can trigger safety alarms in case of 
any potential accidents. Thus, they can foster a better safety culture and 
ensure minimal risks of accidents in a factory environment.

• Robots have high-speed movements, and it is almost impossible to follow these 
movement sequences. As different equipment operates in the industries at a time, 
there are chances of overlapping their radius of actions.   
• Energy beams like lasers or water jets carry a high reserve of energy, and any 
asynchronism can cause uncontrolled release.  
• Robots are programmed machinery. They are sensitive to external errors like 
electromagnetic compatibility. Moreover, there are chances of software corruption 
or malfunction, which can lead to unforeseen circumstances.  
• Mishaps can also result from human errors that can cause issues in the robot’s 
defined operation.Robots are automatic machines that require little to no human intervention to operate. While 
there are several technical disciplines that govern industrial robotics, there are still chances of 
mishaps. Therefore, they cannot be considered completely safe as:
Since the 1980s, several notable fatal accidents related to robots have occurred. Typically, 
accidents do not occur during normal mode operations. The common reasons for accidents 
resulting from robots include any malfunctioning or breakdown, power failure, control defects, 
or similar incidents.As per reports , more than half of the robot accidents in Japan resulted from electronic circuit 
faults. Also, about 20% of issues were due to human faults. Therefore, even if we can govern 
human behavior, system faults cannot be reduced down to zero.Are Industrial Robots 
Completely Safe?\n7
Since industrial robots have complex mechanisms involved, it is also necessary to follow 
robotics safety standards to establish a safe working environment for humans. No matter how 
efficient and productive industrial robots are, there are underlying safety concerns. This is 
why industrial standard bodies have developed several safety standards and guidelines that 
industrial businesses must follow to ensure safe working environments.
OSHA  
OSHA,  or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, outlines the standard regulations 
for hazard-free and safe workplace conditions. These standards are updated regularly based 
on the latest safety guidelines. As per OSHA, each stage of robot development needs risk 
assessment to outline the worker and system safety requirements. Besides, when implementing 
industrial robots, it is also essential to use safeguarding devices. These devices ensure that 
there are fixed barriers to restrict the work area.  
 
OSHA also highlights that awareness devices should be used in the industrial robotics system. 
These can generate warning signals in the form of flashlights or alarms to alert the workers in 
case of crossing the safe proximity levels or any other impending hazards.  
 
Additionally, OSHA also emphasizes routine inspections and regular maintenance of industrial 
robots. Any wear and tear or mechanical malfunctions should be detected beforehand. Another 
important aspect that OSHA outlines is the proper training of those involved in dealing with 
industrial robots. The workers interacting with these intelligent machines must be fully aware of 
the safety standards and features.The three primary versions of robot safety standards are from OSHA, ISO, and ANSI.Safety Principles for 
Industrial Robots\n8OSHA standards related to robotics include 1910 Subpart J, which highlights the general 
environmental controls. The 1910 Subpart O further outlines the machine and machinery 
guarding. It contains standard definitions of different machine parts and operations. The 1910 
Subpart S highlights the electrical work practices, protection, equipment, training, and other 
aspects.
ANSI  
The American National Standards Institute defines safety standards for robotics systems. It 
also outlines the guidelines for manufacturing facilities to integrate industrial robots into their 
operations. These standards are developed along with RIA or the Robotics Industries Association.
 
The most extensive ANSI standard is ANSI/RIA R15.06-1999 . It elaborates on the guidelines about 
the manufacturer requirements, installation, protection, and safeguarding practices related to the 
operation of robots. It also specifies the importance of personnel safety and risk assessment. This 
version has been updated to ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012 . 
ANSI/RIA R15.06-2012 has adopted ISO safety regulations. These international guidelines set the 
global compliance standard for the use of industrial robots. Adhering to these standards assures 
that the latest safety protocols are followed.
ISO 
The International Organization for Standardization  has prepared the international robotics 
standards that define the safety criteria for robot operations. ISO 10218:2011 highlights the 
requirements for robots and robot work cells. There are two parts: ISO 10218-1:2011 and ISO 
10218-2:2011.  
 
ISO 10218-1:2011  defines the requirements for the inherent safe design of industrial robots, 
protection measures, and other associated information. It also discusses the basic hazards related 
to robotic systems and how these risks can be adequately reduced or eliminated.  
ISO 10218-2:2011  is about the safe integration of industrial robot systems. It also describes the 
design, manufacturing, component devices, and other operational aspects of the system. The 
standard highlights the requirements that industrial businesses must follow when implementing 
an integrated manufacturing system.

Major industrial robot systems hazards include:Common Industrial 
Robot Hazards
Environmental hazards
If the operating conditions affect the robot’s operation in any way, there 
might be a risk of hazards. Any power failure, lightning discharge, issues 
in equipment orientation, or potentially hazardous radiation are beyond 
control. However, these anomalies can affect the robot’s performance and 
result in abnormal behavior. As a result, workplace safety will be at risk.
Operational hazards
Any unpredicted or imprecise movement, the unexpected change in the 
program, component malfunctions, breakdowns, or any maloperation can 
cause serious hazards like collision, crushing, and other serious injuries.
Installation hazards
Poor installation of industrial robots and improper testing measures pose 
significant risks to the working environment. Also, as workers are first 
exposed to these systems, they are at increased risk.\n10
Power system failures
Any disruption in the power system can affect the functioning of industrial 
robots. Moreover, disruption in the electric signals can also lead to 
operational failures or malfunctioning of the system at some level. These 
issues can affect workplace safety and also result in hazardous situations.
Control hazards
Software malfunctions, radio or electromagnetic interference, or any 
such controlling errors can affect the functional safety performance of 
the system, resulting in accidents. These hazards can also result from any 
faults in the control system, electrical sub-controls, hydraulic faults, and 
similar issues.
Human errors
Industrial robots need supervision at some levels and cannot be left alone 
to perform the tasks all by themselves. Any unpredicted movement or 
action, incorrect activation of a sub-component, or overlooked critical 
safety functions can lead to hazards. Sometimes, workers put themselves 
in a risky position when they make any mistake in the robotics system’s 
operation, maintenance, or troubleshooting.\n11
There are several instances related to industrial robot accidents.  
In Alabama, a 20-year-old worker was killed due to the abrupt restarting of a robot in an auto 
parts supplier facility. The assembly line stopped due to some fault. About four workers went 
in to check the fault in the robot station when the machine crushed the young woman. OSHA 
investigated this case, cited some serious violations, and imposed a 2.5 million USD fine  on the 
company.
The Washington Fatality Assessment and Control Evaluation (WA FACE) program  
investigates hazards and performs an in-depth analysis of workplace fatalities. It reported an 
unfortunate incident involving a driverless forklift that killed a 45-year-old worker in Washington. 
On sharing an alarm sound from a Laser Guided Vehicle (LGV), he removed a piece of plastic 
and was outside the sensor path. As the LGV resumed operation, he was crushed by the 
elevated forks and was pronounced dead after being rushed to a local hospital.In another case in Ohio, an auto parts manufacturer faced a fine of USD 3.42 
million . A 58-year-old worker suffered from an elbow fracture and serious 
injuries while removing scrap on a robotic press line. Another 22-year-old 
worker suffered a similar fate while coming in contact with operating machine 
parts. OSHA found multiple violations upon investigation even after the 
company assured to improve safety conditions. Thus, a fine was imposed.  
Notable Industrial Robotics 
Accidents\n12
As per OSHA, it is essential to implement an efficient safeguarding strategy to protect 
workplaces involving industrial robots. Following are some of the essential steps industrial 
businesses must take to ensure a safe workplace environment when integrating robots.Safety Considerations for 
Industrial Robots
Safety standards review
At the manufacturer level, it is essential to comply with applicable safety 
regulations and standards when designing robot applications. These 
guidelines and specifications help create a safe working environment. The 
sum total of interlinked devices constitutes a robot. Therefore, the entire 
system must meet safety requirements.
Although these standards differ with countries, there are common 
standards accepted universally, like ISO, ANSI, and OSHA. These governing 
bodies set international guidelines and also update the standards based 
on the latest developments. So, manufacturers should stick to certified 
standards and mention their compliance to ensure that the systems they 
designed are safe.
When buying industrial robots, companies must also review the safety 
standards of the systems. They must question the robot manufacturer 
about the specifications and cross-check that the robots can be safely 
integrated into their workspace.\n13
Risk assessments
Risk assessment and comprehensive hazard analysis must be performed 
when integrating robotic systems. There must be ideal participation 
from employers and workers since they will deal with the system. These 
assessments can help detect any likelihood of risks and develop protective 
measures for risk reduction and safety control.
Here are some considerations that can help in effective risk assessment:
• For risk assessment, choosing an expert in robot applications and process 
operations is important. Also, employees must be included as they deal directly with 
industrial robots.  
• Documentation is an important aspect of risk assessment as the specific guidelines 
associated with the task can be referred to in the future. The potential risks must 
be enlisted for each task, and the team can then decide on the risk recursion 
techniques.  
• After finalizing the appropriate risk reduction techniques, these principles must be 
implemented effectively. Also, all employees must be made aware of the risks and 
how to handle them.  
• There must be periodical reviews as, with time, the requirements might change. 
Besides, as the safety guidelines and standards are updated regularly, the risk 
assessment must include those. Therefore, frequent monitoring and inspections can 
ensure correct safety functions.  
• It is also crucial to periodically validate the training manuals, electrical and 
mechanical drawings, control system safety function settings, sensors, and other 
safeguarding devices. These can help drive continuous improvements.\n14
Risk reduction
Risk reduction measures should be decided based on specific robot 
applications. They should align with the standards hierarchy of controls. 
External risk control measures will include laser scanners, guards and 
barriers, and light curtains. Training professionals can handle internal risk 
reduction measures like built-in safety functions and software settings.  
 
There are non-collaborative robots that operate separately and do not 
need workers’ support. These applications can be physically isolated 
during their operations. Safeguarding devices like fences and barriers, 
safety vision systems, and scanners can serve the purpose. Providing 
adequate clearance when designing the application layout is also a good 
practice. Training the workers dealing with these applications and ensuring 
they know the Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) is also necessary.
 
As collaborative robot applications need the involvement of workers, they 
need specific risk reduction measures based on different tasks. Mostly, 
they have safety functions integrated into their systems that can control 
the speed, force, momentum, and positions.
Adequate safeguarding
Safeguarding devices can help prevent hazards related to restricted space. 
There are presence-sensing devices, fixed and interlocked barrier guards, 
and limiting devices that can safeguard workers from accidents. Awareness 
devices like chain or rope barriers, alarm signals, flashlights, and horns 
should also be implemented as per the risk level.  
 
PPE or Personal Protection Equipment like safety glasses, protective 
footwear, arc glare shields, and hand protection should be used by 
workers when operating with the robot applications.  
Besides, regular inspection and maintenance programs should minimize 
any malfunctioning or breakdown within the system.
\n15
The development of smarter and more advanced industrial robots has brought a whole new 
level of efficiency and productivity to industries across the globe. However, as these machines 
become more advanced, it is critical to ensure that they are also safe to operate alongside 
human workers.
There is a growing need for modular or collaborative robotic systems that can work in 
tandem with human workers, which has led to the development of various safety features 
and protocols. The incorporation of smart solutions that utilize sensors, cameras, and other 
technologies can help mitigate potential hazards and ensure the overall safety of the system.
