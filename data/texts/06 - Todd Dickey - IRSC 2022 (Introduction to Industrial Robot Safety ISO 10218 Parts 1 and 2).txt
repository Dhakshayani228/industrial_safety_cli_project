Industrial robots
●ISO 10218 -2:202X, Robotics –Safety requirements –Part 2: 
Industrial robot systems, robot applications and robot cells\nStandards
●Provide a voluntary means to achieve a desired outcome
●Can become compulsory (i.e., law) when adopted by a regulatory agency
●Drafted by a volunteer committee of representatives of concerned interests 
such as manufacturers of robots and safety devices, users, regulators, 
suppliers, integrators, consultants, and academia
○ Balanced across multiple disciplines
●Developed under the backing of a national orinternational
organization which provides rules and guidance on the standards 
development process
●Development utilizes a consensus process throughout the drafting
○ Consensus implies a majority agreement to the guidance, but does 
not imply unanimous agreement\nKey Terms 
and Concepts\nKey Terms and Concepts
●Industrial Robot
○ Automatically controlled, reprogrammable multipurpose manipulator, 
programmable in three or more axes, which can be either fixed in place 
or mobile for use in industrial automation applications
●Industrial Robot System
○ System comprising:
■ Industrial robot;
■ End-effector(s);
■ Any machinery, equipment, devices, external auxiliary axes or 
sensors supporting the robot performing its task
●Industrial Robot Cell
○ One or more robot systems including associated machinery and 
equipment and the associated safeguarded space and protective 
measures\nRobot, System, Cell
\nKey Terms and Concepts (cont.)
●Normative vs Informative guidance
○ A normative element describes the scope of the document or sets out 
provisions
■ The “required” items are identifiable by the word “shall”
■ Normative references identify requirements found in other standards
○ An informative element provides information intended to assist the 
understanding or use of the document.
■ They are the “good practice” guidance identifiable by the word “should”
■ “Notes” are always informative\nKey Terms and Concepts (cont.)
●Permissive vs Capability guidance
○ A permissive guidance element describes a design feature that is 
allowed/permitted
■ The permitted item is identifiable by the word “may”
Example: “A robot system may be network enabled for remote access.”
○ A capable guidance element describes a design feature that gives a 
machine the capability to perform a certain way.
■ The capable item is identifiable by the word “can”
Example: “Robot systems canhave a potentially large operating volume.”\nKey Terms and Concepts (cont.)
●Practicable
○ Reducing a risk to a level that represents the point, objectively 
assessed, at which the time, trouble, difficulty, and cost of further 
reduction becomes unreasonably disproportionate to the additional 
risk reduction obtained
Example: “Whenever practicable , control devices and control stations 
shall be located so that the operator is able to observe the working area 
or hazard zone.”\nKey Terms and Concepts (cont.)
●Risk Assessment
○ The identification of hazards, estimation of the risk and elimination of 
the hazard or reduction in risk through protective measures
■ Carried out by robot manufacturer when complying with Part 1
■ Carried out by system integrator when complying with Part 2
● When the User of machinery modifies the equipment, they 
are acting as an integrator and Part 2 applies to them
●Functional Safety
○ Refers to ISO 13849 and IEC 62061 for Performance Level and 
Safety Integrity Level determination/requirements respectively\nKey Terms and Concepts (cont.)
●“Collaborative Robot”
○ Refers to robots with incorporated technologies which permit them to be used 
in collaborative applications
○ Types of collaborative applications
■ Safety -rated monitored stop (not considered collaborative in next revision)
■ Hand guiding (HGC)
■ Speed and separation monitoring (SSM)
■ Power and force limiting (PFL)\nKey Terms and Concepts (cont.)
●Verification and Validation
Verification is more of a static method of checking the identification of 
hazards and selected risk reduction measures. Typically done during 
development phase.
(i.e., Is the risk reduction measure appropriate and is it used appropriately?)
Validation is more of a dynamic process of testing the applied risk reduction 
measures. Performed on the completed system.
(i.e., Are the safety functions working correctly?)\nKey Terms and Concepts (cont.)

○ Annex F & G

\nSummary
●ISO 10218 and ANSI/RIA R15.06 are essentially the same.
●Standards are created by volunteers from a variety 
professional disciplines. 
●Standards provide normative and informative guidance and 
can be used as a means to achieve regulatory compliance.
●Functional safety ensures that safety functions relying on a 
control system will be effective for the associated risk(s).​
●“Collaborative” describes a robot application or system NOT a 
type of robot\nQUESTIONS?\nTodd Dickey
