Functional safety of machine controls  
– Application of EN ISO 13849 –
The EN ISO 13849-1 standard, “Safety of machinery – 
Safety-related parts of control systems”, contains provi -
sions governing the design of such parts. This report is 
an update of BGIA Report 2/2008e of the same name. It 
describes the essential subject-matter of the standard in 
its third, revised 2015 edition, and explains its application 
with reference to numerous examples from the fields of 
electromechanics, fluidics, electronics and programmable 
electronics, including control systems employing mixed 
technologies. The standard is placed in its context of the 
essential safety requirements of the Machinery Directive, 
and possible methods for risk assessment are presen -
ted. Based upon this information, the report can be used 
to select the required Performance Level PLr for safety 
functions in control systems. The Performance Level 
PL which is actually attained is explained in detail. The 
requirements for attainment of the relevant Performance 
Level and its associated Categories, component reliability, 
levels of diagnostic coverage, software safety and measu -
res for the prevention of systematic and common-cause 
failures are all discussed comprehensively. Background 
information is also provided on implementation of the 
requirements in real-case control systems. Numerous 
example circuits show, down to component level, how 
Performance Levels a to e can be engineered in the selec -
ted technologies with Categories B to 4. The examples 
provide information on the safety principles employed 
and on components with well-tried safety functionality. 
Numerous literature references permit closer study of the 
examples provided. The report shows how the require -
ments of EN ISO 13849-1 can be implemented in enginee -
ring practice, and thus makes a contribution to consistent 
application and interpretation of the standard at national 
and international level.Kurzfassung

nik, darunter auch Steuerungen gemischter Technologie. 
Der Zusammenhang der Norm mit den grundlegenden 
Sicherheitsanforderungen der Maschinenrichtlinie wird 
aufgezeigt und mögliche Verfahren zur Risikoabschätzung 
werden vorgestellt. Auf der Basis dieser Informationen 
erlaubt der Report die Auswahl des erforderlichen Perfor -
mance Level PLr für steuerungstechnische Sicherheits -
funktionen. Die Bestimmung des tatsächlich erreichten 
Performance Level PL wird detailliert erläutert. Auf die 
Anforderungen zum Erreichen des jeweiligen Performance 
Level und seine zugehörigen Kategorien, auf die Bauteil -
zuverlässigkeit, Diagnosedeckungsgrade, Softwaresicher -
heit und Maßnahmen gegen systematische Ausfälle sowie 
Fehler gemeinsamer Ursache wird im Detail eingegangen. 
Hintergrundinformationen zur Umsetzung der Anforde -
rungen in die steuerungstechnische Praxis ergänzen das 
Angebot. Zahlreiche Schaltungsbeispiele zeigen bis auf 
die Ebene der Bauteile hinunter, wie die Performance 
Level a bis e mit den Kategorien B bis 4 in den jeweiligen 
Technologien technisch umgesetzt werden können. Sie 
geben dabei Hinweise auf die verwendeten Sicherheits -
prinzipien und sicherheitstechnisch bewährte Bauteile. 
Zahlreiche Literaturhinweise dienen einem tieferen Ver -
ständnis der jeweiligen Beispiele. Der Report zeigt, wie 
die Anforderungen der DIN EN ISO 13849-1 in die techni -
sche Praxis umgesetzt werden können, und leistet damit 
einen Beitrag zur einheitlichen Anwendung und Interpre -
tation der Norm auf nationaler und internationaler Ebene.\nRésumé
La sécurité fonctionnelle des systèmes de  
commande de machines  
– Application de la norme DIN EN ISO 13849 –
La norme DIN EN ISO 13849-1 « Sécurité des machines – 
Parties des systèmes de commande relatives à la sécurité 
» définit comment doivent être conçues les parties des 
systèmes de commande relatives à la sécurité. Le présent 
rapport est une version actualisée du rapport 2/2008 du 
même nom du BGIA. Il présente les principaux contenus 
de la norme dans sa troisième édition de 2015, et en 
explique l’application à partir de nombreux exemples pris 
dans les domaines de l’électromécanique, de la tech -
nique des fluides, de l’électronique et de l’électronique 
programmable, et notamment aussi des systèmes de 
commande de technologie mixte. Ce texte met en évi -
dence le lien entre la norme et les exigences essentielles 
de sécurité de la directive Machines, et présente des 
procédures possibles permettant d’évaluer les risques. 
Sur la base de ces informations, le rapport permet de 
sélectionner le niveau de performance PLr nécessaire 
pour les fonctions relatives à la sécurité des systèmes 
de commande. Il explique aussi en détail la manière de 
déterminer le niveau de performance PL effectivement 
atteint. Le rapport traite également en détail des exigen -
ces à satisfaire pour atteindre le niveau de performance 
donné et ses catégories correspondantes, de la fiabilité 
des composants, des taux de couverture de diagnostic, 
de la sécurité des logiciels et des mesures à prendre con -
tre les défaillances systématiques, ainsi que contre les 
erreurs de cause commune. Cette offre est complétée par 
des informations générales concernant la mise en œuvre 
des exigences dans la pratique de la technique de com -
mande. De nombreux exemples de circuits allant jusqu’au 
niveau des composants montrent comment les niveaux 
de performance ‘a’ à ‘e’ avec les catégories B à 4 peuvent 
être réalisés techniquement dans les technologies res -
pectives. Ils fournissent des indications sur les principes 
de sécurité utilisés et sur les composants techniques qui 
ont fait leurs preuves en matière de sécurité. De nombreu -
ses références bibliographiques permettent d’approfondir 
la compréhension des différents exemples. Montrant 
comment les exigences de la norme DIN EN ISO 13849-1 
peuvent être mises en œuvre dans la pratique technique, 
le rapport contribue ainsi à ce que la norme soit utilisée et 
interprétée de manière identique, tant au niveau national 
qu’international.Resumen

The thoroughly revised version of the EN ISO 13849-1 con -
trol standard was published nine years ago. BGIA-Report 
2/2008e, “Functional safety of machine controls – Appli -
cation of DIN EN ISO 13849”, appeared shortly afterwards 
and like the preceding report published in June 1997 
proved once again to be a best-seller. Since then, over 
20,000 orders have been met for copies of the printed 
German version. The number of downloads from the web -
site of the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of 
the German Social Accident Insurance (IFA) is even higher.
With this report and further tools for application of the 
standard – the widely used SISTEMA software application, 
the SISTEMA cookbooks and the disc calculator – the 
IFA has made an important contribution to successful 
introduction of the new strategies for assessing and 
designing the reliability of electronic and programmable 
control systems. This strategy, which gives consideration 
to the probabilities of failure of components, is en shrined 
in the IEC 61508 series of basic safety standards and is 
now established in almost all sectors of industry, inclu -
ding machine construction. Not least thanks to the close 
involvement of experienced experts at the IFA, the authors 
of EN ISO 13849-1 have succeeded in presenting its con -
tent and developing it further such that it remains practi -
cal in its application, despite the complexity of the sub -
ject-matter. The preceding EN 954 standard with its purely 
deterministic requirements has finally been re placed. The 
Performance Level is now firmly established in machine 
construction.Over the past years, EN ISO 13849-1 has become estab -
lished worldwide as the definitive standard for machine 
controls, and further practical experience with it has been 
gathered. The IFA‘s experts have commented in publica -
tions of their own upon the essential issues concerning 
application of this standard, and have discussed their 
opinions on standards committees. The result was the 
publication in 2015 of the third edition of EN ISO 13849-1.
Now is therefore an appropriate time for a revised IFA 
Report on safety-related machine control systems. 
The team of authors has revised the entire report and 
all examples. The changes to the standard have also 
re ceived particular intention and have been interpreted. 
The present document is the English version of the report.
This report, and the examples of controls that can be 
imported into SISTEMA, provide all stakeholders with 
straightforward access to the normative methods that 
have now become good practice. The report is intended as 
a tutorial and a reference work. It is not, of course, a sub-
stitute for the standard itself. However, it contains valu -
able advice, and in particular, experience and guidance 
that has already been developed in the field.

Since 1 January 1995, all machines placed on the market 
within the European Economic Area have been required 
to satisfy the essential requirements of the Machinery 
Directive [1]. In accordance with Article 2 of this directive, 
a machine is the assembly of linked parts or components, 
at least one of which moves, with the appropriate actua -
tors, control and power circuits, etc., joined together for a 
specific application, in particular for the processing, treat -
ment, moving or packaging of a material. In the amended 
2006/42/EC [2] version of the Machinery Directive, safety 
components which are independently placed on the mar -
ket by manufacturers in order to fulfil a safety function, 
the failure and/or malfunction of which endangers the 
safety of persons, and which are not necessary in order 
for the machinery to function or for which normal compo -
nents may be substituted in order for the machinery to 
function, are also included under the term “machinery” in 
the sense of the directive. The formal definition of “machi -
nery” is also satisfied by interchangeable equipment, 
certain lifting accessories, chains, ropes and webbing. 
Detailed explanations of the individual points can be 
found in the Guide to application of the Machinery Direc -
tive 2006/42/EC [2]. The directive now also applies to 
incomplete machines.
The essential requirements of the Machinery Directive for 
the design and construction of machines and safety com -
ponents can be found in Annex I of the directive. In addi -
tion to general principles for the integration of safety, this 
annex contains dedicated subclauses governing controls 
for machines and the requirements placed upon protec -
tive devices. The essential safety requirements applicable 
to the design of machines and safety components oblige 
manufacturers to conduct a risk assessment in order to 
identify any hazards associated with the machine. Three 
principles are stated, in the following order, by which 
the accident risks associated with each hazard are to be 
re duced to an acceptable level:
•	The elimination or reduction of risks by inherently safe 
design
•	The taking of necessary measures for protection in rela -
tion to risks that cannot be eliminated
•	 The informing of users of the residual risks, particular 
training, instruction and personal protective equipment
Under Article 7 , the observance of harmonized Euro -
pean standards the reference of which is listed in the 
Official Journal of the European Union (EU) gives rise to a 
presumption of conformity with the essential health and 
safety requirements of the Machinery Directive. Several 
hundred harmonized European standards detail/sup -port the underlying philosophy set out in Annex I of the 
Machinery Directive for the attainment of occupational 
safety and health on machines. EN ISO 12100 [3], a Type 
A standard now comprising a single part only, governs 
basic concepts and general principles for design for the 
safety of machinery. Content of the former EN ISO 14121-1 
standard – the full procedure for identifying hazards and 
for risk estimation and risk evaluation of each indivi -
dual hazard – has also been incorporated into the new 
EN ISO 12100 [3] standard. In addition to the standards, 
the ISO/TR 14121-2:2013 [4] technical report serves as a 
practical guide to risk assessment, and contains methodi -
cal examples. 
Based upon the (generic) EN ISO 12100 [3] standard, 
the updated EN ISO 13849-1:2015 [5] and EN ISO 13849-
2:2012 [6] series of standards describes the risk reduction 
required during the design, structuring and integration 
of safety-related parts of control systems and protective 
devices, regardless of whether they are electrical, elec -
tronic, hydraulic, pneumatic or mechanical in nature. 
These standards present a generically applicable system 
of methods for machine controls and/or their protective 
devices. The Performance Levels described in the stan -
dards extend the concept of Categories familiar from 
EN 954-1. The safety architectures can now be employed 
with significantly more flexibility. An essential advan -
tage of EN ISO 13849-1 is its treatment of safety-related 
parts of control systems independently of the techno -
logy em ployed, as has already been mentioned. The 
Performance Level enables different control structures 
em ploying different technologies to be combined easily. 
The standard offers everything needed from a single 
source comprising approximately 100 pages. The methods 
are formulated neutrally with regard to the specific appli -
cation or the technology employed, and are therefore 
referenced by virtually all product standards for machine 
safety (generally Type C standards).
With entry into force of the revised 2006/42/EC Machinery 
Directive [2] in December 2009, the harmonized stan -
dard acquired greater importance. This can be attributed 
principally to the new provision that safety-related logic 
– also described as the safety-related parts of control 
systems – has been included in Annex IV of the directive. 
Annex IV products of this kind are subject to special treat -
ment under the directive, unless they are manufactured in 
accordance with harmonized standards the reference of 
which is listed in the Official Journal. \n122 Introduction
On the one hand, Annex IV products are not in principle 
subject to compulsory EC type examination1; they can, 
for example, be placed on the market on the basis of an 
extended manufacturer‘s quality management system 
assessed by a notified body. However, the new directive 
resulted in control systems becoming more strongly the 
focus of the safety analysis [7; 8].
In its third, 2015 edition, EN ISO 13849-1 is the successor 
standard to EN 954-1:1996 [9], and is already listed in the 
Official Journal of the EU. The presumption of conformity 
to which the 2008 version gave rise expired on 30 June 
2016. The three-year transitional period in which EN 954-1 
remained valid in parallel has long expired; users may 
therefore use this standard, if at all, only by making 
dated reference to individual subclauses of it. Part 2 of 
EN ISO 13849-2 [6] was published in 2012 following revi -
sion.
The purpose of the present revised IFA Report is to 
describe the application of EN ISO 13849 and in particular 
its practical implementation with reference to numerous 
model solutions. Particular attention has been attached 
to the presentation and interpretation of the new or 
revised requirements set out in the third edition of EN 
ISO 13849-1. Neither the explanations nor the examples 
should be regarded as an official national or European 
comment upon (DIN) EN ISO 13849-1. Rather, the report is 
a compilation of thirty-five years‘ experience gained at the 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the Ger -
man Social Accident Insurance (IFA) in the assessment of 
safety and control equipment employing various forms of 
technology, and the institute‘s many years of participation on relevant national and international standards commit -
tees.
Chapter 3 deals with the generic standards governing 
functional safety on machines and machinery installati -
ons. Chapter 4 presents an overview of the structure of 
this report with regard to application of EN ISO 13849.
The authors hope that this report will be of genuine assis -
tance during design and operation activities and will pro -
vide OSH experts with firm support in implementing the 
requirements upon the safety-related parts of control sys -
tems. The present interpretation of the standard has been 
tested in practice in diverse applications, and the princip -
les underpinning the examples have been implemented 
in technical form in numerous actual cases.
The IFA web page at www.dguv.de/ifa/13849e serves as a 
portal for the IFA‘s information on the functional safety of 
machine controls (Figure 2.1). The free SISTEMA software 
application (the German acronym “SISTEMA” stands for 
safety of controls on machinery) is available for download 
from this portal, as are the SISTEMA project files for the 
circuit examples shown in Chapter 8. Future extensions 
are planned to provide up-to-date assistance.
For readers already familiar with BGIA Report 2/2008e, 
a brief summary is provided at the beginning of each 
chapter of this report of the essential changes with 
 respect to the BGIA Report 2/2008e.  i
1 As an alternative to EC type examination, the current Machinery Directive enables the manufacturer to perform his own conformity 
assessment procedure in conjunction with internal production monitoring, in areas in which harmonized standards exist.\n132 Introduction

\n14\n153 Generic standards concerning the functional safety of machinery 
control systems
In addition to EN ISO 13849, which is discussed in this 
report, alternative generic standards of relevance exist 
in the area of functional safety2. As shown in Figure 3.1, 
these standards are those of the IEC 61508 series [10], 
and their sector standard IEC 62061 [11] for the machinery 
industry. Both of these are limited in their scope to electri -
cal, electronic and programmable electronic systems.
A classification system involving “Safety Integrity Levels” 
(SILs) is set out in IEC 61508 and IEC 62061. The SILs serve 
as indicators of the level of safety-related reliability. The 
associated values are target failure measures, each com -
prising a decade3. IEC 61508 distinguishes two different 
applications of safety functions:
•	Safety functions in low demand mode (max. frequency 
of demands once per year)
•	Safety functions in high demand mode or continuous 
mode
In low demand mode, the dimension for the safety is the 
average probability of a dangerous failure of a safety func -
tion at the point in time of the demand: PFDavg. In the high demand or continuous mode of operation, the average 
probability of a dangerous failure per hour PFHD4 is eva -
luated by IEC 62061 (for further information, refer also to 
[12]). With certain exceptions, only the second definition 
is relevant in the machinery sector and thus in IEC 62061. 
The new edition of EN ISO 13849-1 has also adopted this 
definition of the operating mode, and limits the scope of 
the standard accordingly. SIL 4 systems with higher risks 
are unknown in the area of machinery, and are not there -
fore considered in IEC 62061 (Figure 3.2, see Page 16). 
The essential approach of the standards governing func -
tional safety (IEC 61508 and  IEC 62061) developed by the 
International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), namely 
that of defining probabilities of failure as the characteris -
tic parameter without the specific inclusion of architec -
tures, initially appears more universal. The approach 
of EN ISO 13849-1, however, offers users the facility for 
developing and evaluating safety functions, ranging from 
a sensor to an actuator (e.g. a valve), under the umbrella 
of one standard, even though the functions may involve 
different technologies. Part 1 of EN ISO 13849 is accompa -
nied by a Part 2 with the title of “Validation”. The present 
edition, published in 2012, also considers the current
EN ISO 13849 IEC 61508SRP/CS employing

2 In this context, functional safety means that potential hazards that arise as a consequence of failures of a control system,  
i.e. a malfunction, are dealt with.
3 In addition, deterministic requirements are imposed that must be satisfied in the level concerned.
4 In the second edition of IEC 61508:2010 – but not in its sector standard, IEC 62061 – the PFH was reformulated as the “average 
frequency of a dangerous failure of the safety function”. The original abbreviation ( PFH) was however retained (without the “D” 
suffix in IEC 61508).\n163 Generic standards concerning the functional safety of machinery control systems

topics of Part 1. Annexes A to D of Part 2 contain compre -
hensive material on the subjects of “basic safety prin -
ciples“, “well-tried safety principles”, “well-tried compo -
nents” and “fault lists”. Details can be found in Annex C 
of the present report.
The apparent overlap in regulatory scope of the two 
spheres of standardization initially appears unfavoura -
ble to manufacturers of control systems and other users 
of standards. Both EN ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 are 
harmonized standards under the Machinery Directive. 
Parts 1 to 4 of IEC 61508 have the status of basic safety 
standards from the IEC perspective (with the exception of 
simple systems); this series of standards cannot however 
be harmonized under the Machinery Directive, even as a 
European standard. This situation prompts for example 
the following questions:
•	What standard(s) should be applied for compliance 
with the Machinery Directive?
•	Where they overlap in their scope, do the standards 
yield equivalent results?
•	Are the classification systems of the standards, such as 
Categories, Performance Level (PL) and Safety Integrity 
Level (SIL), compatible?
•	Can devices which have been developed in observance 
of one of the two standards be employed during imple -
mentation of a safety function in accordance with a 
different standard?
For attainment of the greatest possible compatibility 
with IEC, and if possible to permit merging of the two 
spheres of standardization in the long term and also to 
enable the benefits of the probability approach to be 
exploited without abandonment of the proven Categories, EN ISO 13849-1, as the successor standard to EN 954-1, 
attempts the balancing-act of uniting both the determini -
stic approach of the Categories and the aspect of safety 
reliability with the definition of the Performance Level (PL) 
(see also [13]). Numerically, corresponding classes (see 
Figure 3.2) exist which permit rapid preliminary estima -
tions for practical day-to-day use. 
In the sense of the standard, the designated architectures 
are more an optional facility (simplified approach) than a 
requirement. They should however be regarded as a key 
element in simplification of the probabilistic approach 
implemented in EN ISO 13849, and their application is 
one of the tenets of this report. The scope of IEC 62061 
indicates that it also covers complex, e.g. programmable 
electronics. Although this is correct, the development of 
“SRECSs” (see Figure 3.1) employing this technology must 
nonetheless satisfy the requirements of the standard in 
accordance with IEC 61508. The scope for the use of  
SRP/CS developed against the standards originating at 
IEC is emphasized by the new edition of EN ISO 13849-1. 
This means that such SRP/CS can be considered equally 
valid when used for the implementation of safety func -
tions under EN ISO 13849-1.
Decisive arguments from the point of view of users in the 
field for selecting EN ISO 13849 as a basis for the imple -
mentation of functional safety in the area of machinery 
may be considered to be the cross-discipline approach 
with regard to technology, and the simplified approach to 
quantification with the use of the designated architectu -
res. This includes the detailed consideration of non-elec -
trical and electromechanical components. Large-volume 
producers of a safety component, such as a programma -
ble logic controller (PLC) for safety applications, will of 
course in particular wish to serve other world markets 
in addition to that of machinery, and will therefore base \n173 Generic standards concerning the functional safety of machinery control systems
their development activity upon IEC 61508 in addition to 
EN ISO 13849.
The table previously found in identical form in the intro -
ductions of EN ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 for selection 
of the appropriate standard for the relevant application 
has now been deleted from both standards. A guidance 
document on application of EN ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 
during the design of safety-related machine controls 
exists, although it has received little attention. As a sector 
standard of IEC 61508, IEC 62061 naturally describes the 
aspect of “management of functional safety” very expli -
citly. Development and verification of embedded software 
to EN ISO 13849-1 is based upon the essential require -
ments for safety-related software that are currently stan -
dard practice and are also described in IEC 61508. Broad 
agreement exists however that requirements from the 
two standards should not be mixed. The ISO/TR 23849 
guidance document [14] was developed by members of 
both standards committees and was published in 2010 by 
ISO and IEC. Its core messages are:
•	The methods described by the two standards differ, but 
can attain a comparable level of risk reduction.
•	Activities merging the two standards require adequate 
experience with their application in practice.
The IEC proposed merging of the two standards to form 
an ISO/IEC standard as long ago as 2011, and began work in 2012. The result of an international survey conducted 
during work on ISO/IEC 17305 showed clearly that the 
13849 standards predominated in application among 
machine manufacturers and end users. As shown in 
Figure 3.3, EN ISO 13849-1 was used by 90%, i.e. the great 
majority of the 715 persons surveyed. Development of the 
planned ISO/IEC 17305 standard was the subject of hea -
ted discussion among experts. The protracted discussions 
had resulted in the project being at least two years behind 
its original schedule. The working group was already 
aware of the essential need to consider backward compa -
tibility to EN ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061. Straightforward 
application of the new standard and retention of existing 
methods were explicit objectives. The question whether 
a new standard would have met these objectives and 
whether it would have been able to replace the existing 
standards cannot be answered. In October 2015,  
ISO/TC 199 took the decision to abandon the work on a 
joint standard and to suspend the working group‘s activi -
ties. No sooner had the work officially stopped however, 
than it became clear that the topic would not rest. Recom -
mendations are therefore to be formulated for whether 
and if so how a future joint project concerning functional 
safety could be conducted jointly by the two standards 
organizations. Both standards will be revised in the near 
future in the course of “routine maintenance”. The results 
of the work conducted to date on ISO/IEC 17305 will be 
taken up in both standards.

This chapter cross-references the further chapters and

it provides an overview of the iterative process for design of the safety-related parts of control systems, based upon 
Figure 4.1, which corresponds to Figure 3 of the standard. 
The changes between the second and third editions of the 
standard, and its future development, are discussed at 
the end of the chapter.
4.1 Identification of safety functions and 
their properties
The design and assessment process begins with a well-
tried concept, that of the definition of one or more safety 
functions (SFs). The procedure is shown in Figure 4.1 by 
blocks 1 to 3, and is described in greater detail in Chap -
ter 5. The question to be answered is: in what way do 
the safety-related parts of the control system contribute 
towards reducing the risk of a hazard on a machine?

In the first instance, a machine should be constructed 
such that it is no longer able to present a hazard in use 
(inherent safety). The second step is then that of reducing 
the risk of any hazard that may still arise. This can be 
attained by protective measures, which often comprise 
a combination of protective equipment and safe control. 
In order for these protective measures to attain a defined 
quality in consideration of the risk, an essential step is 
that of risk assessment, as required by the Machinery 
Directive and described in EN ISO 12100 [3]. Protective 
devices are regarded in the sense of EN ISO 13849-1 
(safeguards) together with the safe control as the safety-
related part of a control system. Together, they execute a 
safety function; they may for example prevent unexpected 
start-up when an operator enters a hazard zone. Since 
a machine can easily have several safety functions (for 
example for automatic and setup modes), it is important 
for careful consideration to be given to each individual 
hazard and the associated safety function.
The safety function can be assumed by parts of the 
machine control system or by components required in 
addition to it. In both cases, these parts are safety-related 
parts of control systems. Although the same hardware 
may well be involved in the performance of different 
safety functions, the required quality of the risk reduc -
tion for each SF may differ. In the standard, the quality 
of the risk reduction is defined by the term “Performance 
Level” (PL). The result of the risk assessment determines 
the level of the PL value required for the safety function. 
This specification for the design of the control system is 
de scribed as the “required Performance Level”, PLr. How 
is the PLr obtained?
The risk of a hazard on a machine can be reduced not only 
by the control system, but also for example by a guard, 
such as a guard door, or by personal protective equip -
ment, such as safety goggles. Once it has been establis -
hed what part is to be played by the protective measures 
provided by the control system, the required Performance 
Level PLr is determined quickly and directly with the aid of 
a simple decision tree, the “risk graph”. Is the associated 
injury irreversible (e.g. death, loss of limbs), or reversible 
(e.g. crushing injuries, which can heal)? Is the operator 
present in the danger zone frequently and for long periods 
(e.g. more frequently than once every fifteen minutes), or 
infrequently and briefly? Is the operator still able to avoid 
an accident (e.g. owing to slow machine movements)? 
These three questions determine the PLr. Details can be 
found in subclause 5.4, examples in Annex A. 
4.2 Design and technical implementation of 
the safety functions
Once the requirements upon the safety-related parts 
of control systems have been defined, they are first 
 designed, and then implemented. Finally, a verification is conducted to ascertain whether the required risk 
reduction, the target PLr value (block 6 in Figure 4.1), can 
be attained by means of the planned implementation 
(blocks 4 and 5 in Figure 4.1) with the actual PL value. 
The steps of blocks 4 and 5 are described in detail in 
Chapter 6. Following the tradition of the previous control 
system reports, Chapter 8 of this report also contains 
a large number of formulated circuit examples for all 
control technologies and each Category. In addition, the 
general descriptions contained in Chapters 5, 6 and 7 are 
accompanied by a comprehensive description of a circuit 
example (paper cutting guillotine). This provides the 
developer with an illustrative explanation of the methods 
and parameters described below.
Safety-related parts of control systems are able to exert 
their risk-reducing effect only if the safety function was 
correctly defined from the outset. During the ensuing 
implementation, quality criteria are applied in the form 
of the quality of the components employed (lifetime), 
their interaction (dimensioning), the effectiveness of 
diagnostics (e.g. self-tests) and the fault tolerance of the 
structure. These parameters determine the average pro -
bability of a dangerous failure per hour ( PFHD) and thus 
the attained PL. EN ISO 13849-1 places the methods by 
which the PL is calculated at the user‘s discretion. Even 
the highly complex Markov  modelling method may there -
fore be used, subject to the parameters stated above. 
The standard, however, describes a much simplified 
procedure, namely the use of designated architectures 
with application of a bar chart (see Page 61, Figure 6.10), 
in which the modelling of the PL is already taken up. 
Experts interested in the bar chart‘s derivation will find it 
in Annex G.
The Categories continue to be the basis upon which the 
PL is determined. Their definition remains essentially 
unchanged since the first edition of the standard; since 
the second edition however, additional requirements 
have been imposed upon the component quality and the 
effectiveness of diagnostics. Adequate measures against 
common cause failure are required in addition for the 
Categories 2, 3 and 4 (see Table 4.1).
Table 6.2 (Page 50) provides a summary of the Catego -
ries. An essential aspect when the proposed simplified 
calculation method is used is the presentation of the 
Categories as logical block diagrams, termed “designated 
architectures”. 
Since the Categories require analysis of the faults (avoi -
dance and control of failures), additional aspects concern 
the reliability of the individual components, their failure 
modes, and fault detection by automatic diagnostic 
measures. Fault lists and safety principles serve here as 
a basis (see Annex C). In addition to the traditional FMEA 
(failure mode and effects analysis), EN ISO 13849-1 offers \n214 Report and standard: an overview

One of the questions most frequently asked regarding 
the probability of failure concerns the sourcing of reliable 
failure data for the safety-related components, the MTTFD 
(mean time to dangerous failure) values. The manufac -
turer of the parts or components, i.e. his technical data 
sheet, should be given preference here over all other 
sources. Many component manufacturers already provide 
such data. Even where manufacturers‘ data are not avail-
able however, typical example values can be obtained 
from established databases (such as SN 29500 or  
IEC/TR 62380). The standard and Annex D of this report 
also list a number of realistic values obtained from the 
field, and provide information on modelling in the safety-
related block diagram.
The effectiveness of diagnostics, in the form of the DCavg 
value (average diagnostic coverage), can be determined 
according to the following simple principle: the test meas-
ures that monitor the block are compiled for each block. 
For each of these test measures, one of four typical DC 
values is determined from a table in the standard. An ave -
raging formula, which appears complex but is essentially 
simple, can be used to calculate the DCavg parameter from 
it. Further information can be found in subclause 6.2.14 
and Annex E.
The final parameter, that of the CCF (common cause fai -
lure, subclause 6.2.15), is similarly easy to calculate: for 
this parameter, it is assumed that a cause, such as con -tamination, overtemperature or short circuit, can under 
certain circumstances give rise to several faults which 
may for example simultaneously disable both control 
channels. For control of this source of hazard, it must 
be demonstrated for Category 2, 3 and 4 systems that 
adequate measures have been taken against CCF. This is 
achieved by means of a points system for eight typical, 
for the most part technical counter-measures, with which 
at least 65 of a possible 100 points must be attained (for 
details, see Annex F).
The random hardware failures, which can be controlled 
by a good structure and by low probability of failure, are 
accompanied by the broad field of systematic faults – 
i.e. faults inherent to the system since its design, such 
as dimensioning faults, software faults, or logical faults 
– against which protection is to be provided by meas-
ures for fault avoidance and control. The software faults 
account for a large proportion of such faults. Since its 
second edition, the standard has included the requi -
rements upon the safety-related software; individual 
aspects of them have however long been familiar from 
relevant standards. The actual measures are graded 
according to the required PL. Further information can be 
found in subclause 6.1.2 for systematic failures and in 
subclause 6.3 for software.
4.3 Verification and validation of the control 
system for each safety function
If the design has already reached an advanced stage by 
the time that the achieved PL is determined, the question 
arises as to whether this PL is sufficient for each safety \n224 Report and standard: an overview
function executed by the control system. For this purpose, 
the PL is compared with the required PLr (see Block 6, 
Figure 4.1). If the PL attained for a safety function is infe -
rior to the required PLr, design improvements on a greater 
or lesser scale are required (such as the use of alternative 
components with a superior MTTFD), until an adequate PL 
is ultimately attained. Once this hurdle has been over -
come, a series of validation steps are necessary. Part 2 of 
EN ISO 13849 comes into play at this point. This validation 
process systematically assures that all functional and 
performance requirements placed upon the safety-related 
parts of the control system have been attained (see Block 
7 , Figure 4.1). Further details can be found in Chapter 7 .
4.4 Changes arising from the third edition of 
the standard published in 2015
With Amendment 1, the third edition of the standard 
was produced from the second. The amended passages 
primarily serve to improve comprehension and applica -
tion. A detailed overview focusing upon the changes was 
pub  lished by the IFA in 2015 [15]. The essential changes 
include consideration, during specification of the required 
Performance Level (PLr), of the probability of occurrence of 
a hazardous event; a new, simplified method for determi -
ning the PL for the output part of the safety-related part of 
the control system (SRP/CS); and a proposal for the hand -
ling of requirements for SRESW (safety-related embedded 
software) when standard components are used. Table 4.2 
shows which main changes have been made in which 
subclauses of the standard and of the present report.
The example circuits in Chapter 8 of the report have been 
thoroughly updated from the 2008 versions based upon 
the above changes to the standard.
4.5 Future development of EN ISO 13849-1
The third edition of EN ISO 13849-1 replaces the previ -
ous edition without a specific transition period. Since 
the changes – as described in the preceding subclause 
– essentially concern additions, updating and improve -
ments, however, the transition from the second to the 
third edition of the standard is not generally critical. As 
it has done for some time, the IFA is supporting this pro -cess with freely available guides to application. These 
guides take the form both of explanatory reference with 
examples, and of the “SISTEMA” free software program 
(the acronym stands for “Safety Integrity Software Tool 
for the Evaluation of Machine Applications”), which sup -
ports calculation and documentation of PLr  and PL (see 
Annex H). The series of SISTEMA cookbooks, which has 
been continually extended, is devoted to particular topics 
that are relevant during application of the standard. These 
concern not only SISTEMA itself (the SISTEMA libraries, 
use of network libraries, “Running several instances 
of SISTEMA in parallel”), but also the entire process of 
design  against the standard (“Definition of safety func -
tions”, “From the schematic circuit diagram to the Perfor -
mance Level”, “When the designated architectures don‘t 
match”). Finally, the resources include the “Performance 
Level Calculator”[16] developed by the IFA. This presents 
the bar chart in the form of a rotating disc by means of 
which the PFHD and PL can be determined easily and 
precisely at any time. All further resources and reference – 
such as information on the test standards and principles 
[17] of DGUV Test, the test and certification system of the 
German Social Accident Insurance – can be found on the 
IFA‘s website at: www.dguv.de/ifa/13849.
During work on the third edition of EN ISO 13849-1, seve -
ral major work packages were identified that lay outside 
the scope of an amendment. These included, for example, 
thorough revision of the software requirements, in order 
to improve its suitability for application in practice, and 
also consistent precision of when “SRP/CS” refers to the 
entire control system executing a safety function, and 
when to a subsystem that executes only a part of the 
safety function. In order for these proposals to be imple -
mented in the longer term, the committee responsible for 
the standard decided as early as 2016 , following publica -
tion of the third edition, to begin work on a revision of the 
standard. The IFA will support this activity as it has done 
effectively in the past, in order for the anticipated results 
(possibly in the form of a fourth edition of the standard) 
once again to be prepared for practical application as 
described above.\n234 Report and standard: an overview

This Report deals with safety functions and their contribu -
tion to reducing risks in hazard zones on machinery. The 
design of such safety functions is part of a process for the 
design of safe machines. This chapter therefore begins by 
addressing the requirements of the Machinery Directive, 
before describing the definition of safety functions and 
their properties. Subclause 5.7 then demonstrates imple -
mentation with reference to the practical example of a 
paper cutting guillotine control.
5.1 Requirements of the EC Machinery 
Directive
The EC Machinery Directive [2] has been transposed into 
German law by the German Product Safety Act (ProdSG), 
and sets out essential health and safety requirements for 
machines. The general provisions of the Machinery Direc -
tive are supported by standards. Particularly significant 
in this respect is EN ISO  12100 [3], Safety of machinery 
–General principles for design. The machine designer is 
presented with a design method that is suitable for achie -
ving machine safety. This method – a strategy for risk 
reduction – includes the design of safety-related parts of 
control systems1.Provided a harmonized product-specific standard (Type C 
standard) exists for the machine being designed and 
the reference of this standard has been published in 
the Official Journal of the EU [18], it may be assumed 
that the essential health and safety requirements are 
satisfied. In such cases, the standard is said to give rise 
to a “presumption of conformity”, since its application 
justifies the assumption that the machine satisfies the 
requirements of the EC Machinery Directive. The strategy 
for risk reduction must however always be followed where 
a standard giving rise to the presumption of conformity 
does not exist, where a suitable standard exists but the 
design has deviated from it, or where additional aspects 
apply that are not covered by the product standard. In 
order for issues not covered by a product standard to be 
identified, the first two steps in the risk reduction strategy 
described below must always be performed, i.e. the limits 
of the machinery must be defined and the hazards iden -
tified.
5.2 Risk reduction strategy
The risk reduction strategy presented in EN ISO 12100 [3] 
was adopted in Figure 1 of EN ISO 13849-1 and supple -
mented with the aspects detailed in the latter standard 
(see Figure 5.1). A risk assessment is first performed. An 
important point is the assumption during the following 
steps that no protective measures have as yet been taken 
on the machine. Ultimately, the entire risk reduction pro -
cess serves to determine the type and also the “quality” 
of the protective measure/safeguard that is to be imple -
mented.
The risk reduction process begins with definition of the 
limits of the machine. Besides the space limits and time 
limits of the machine, attention must be paid in particular 
to its use limits. Such limits include the intended use of 
the machine (e.g. materials which may permissibly be 
machined on it), including all operating modes and the 
various intervention procedures. Reasonably foreseeable 
misuse of the machine must also be considered; this 
includes consideration for the defeating of safeguards.
1 Safety-related parts of control systems are one means by which a safety function is implemented. The starting-point for these 
systems is the reception of safety-related input signals, for example detection of the position of a guard door by means of a Type 2 
position switch, the separate actuator of which is fitted to the door and itself constitutes a safety-related part. Once received, the 
signals are processed, leading to generation of an output signal.i\n265 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction

The hazards are then identified; all phases of the 
machine‘s lifetime must be considered in this process. In 
addition to automatic mode, particular attention is paid to 
operating modes requiring manual intervention, e.g. for:
•	Setting
•	Testing
•	Teaching/programming
•	Commissioning
•	Material charging
•	Retrieval of the product
•	Troubleshooting and fault clearance
•	Cleaning
•	Maintenance  
Further details of this process step can be found in 
EN ISO 12100 [3]. A range of methods exist for systematic 
identification of the hazards; examples can be found 
in ISO/DTR 14121-2 [4]. Possible hazards are also listed 
extensively in EN ISO 12100 [3]. Figure 5.2 shows an 
excerpt.
5.2.1 Risk estimation
Once all potential hazards which may be presented by the 
machine have been identified, the risk must be estima -
ted for each hazard. The risk associated with a particular 
hazardous situation can be determined from the following 
risk elements:
a) Severity of harm
b) Probability of this harm occurring as a function of:
 –Exposure of a person/of persons to the hazard
 – A hazardous event occurring
 –The technical and human possibilities for avoidance 
or limitation of the harmThe objective of the further procedure is to reduce the risk 
to an acceptable level. For this purpose, Figure 5.3 shows 
the proportions of risk reduction with and without safety-
related parts of a control system. Further information on 
the subject of risk can be found in the IFA Manual [19].
5.2.2 Risk evaluation
Following the risk estimation, a risk evaluation is per -
formed in order to determine whether a risk reduction is 
necessary. The criteria for adequate risk reduction are 
specified in EN 12100 [3]:
•	Have all operating conditions and all intervention pro -
cedures been considered?
•	Have hazards been eliminated by suitable protective 
measures or the risks reduced to the lowest practicable 
level?
•	Has it been ensured that the measures taken do not 
give rise to new hazards?
•	Have the users been sufficiently informed and warned 
concerning the residual risks?
•	Has it been ensured that the protective measures taken 
do not adversely affect the operators‘ working condi -
tions or the usability of the machine?
•	Are the protective measures taken compatible with one 
another?
•	Has sufficient consideration been given to the conse -
quences that can arise from the use in a non-profes-
sional/non-industrial context of a machine designed for 
professional/industrial use?

5.3 Identification of the required safety 
functions and their properties
Should the evaluation identify an (as-yet) unacceptable 
risk, appropriate safeguards must be provided. Priority 
is however to be given to efforts by which hazards are 
avoided (inherently safe design), or at least reduced to 
the greatest possible extent, by design modifications to 
the machine. In principle, information for use (including 
organizational measures) is also a possible means of risk 
reduction. Measures of this kind are acceptable however 
only in exceptional cases in which an economically rea -
sonable risk reduction by means of technical protective 
measures is not possible; in the majority of cases, safegu -
ards will however be required. In this context, safety func -tions are defined that are executed by the SRP/CS (safety-
related parts of control systems) (see Figure 5.4).
An iterative process for design of the safety-related parts 
of control systems is set out in [5] (Figure 4.1). Figure 5.5 
shows the part relevant to this subclause of the report.

5.3.1 Definition of safety functions
The necessary safety functions are defined in considera -
tion of both the application and the hazard. For example, 
if flying debris must be anticipated, a light curtain will 
be an unsuitable solution, and an arrester (guard) will 
be required. A safety function is therefore a function by 
which measures (including measures in the control tech -
nology) reduce the risk presented by a particular hazard to 
an acceptable level. In the absence of relevant provi  sions 
in a Type C standard, the safety functions are de fined by 
the designer of the machine, e.g.:
a) Controlled stopping of the movement and application 
of the holding brake in the rest position
b) Prevention of a crushing point being caused by 
descending machine parts
c) Reduction of the power of a cutting laser where the eye 
is directly exposed
d) Prevention of dropping of the shaft in setup mode
e) Evasion of the robot when a person enters its danger 
zonef) Prevention of entrapment of persons
g) Stopping of the closing movement controlled by two-
hand operation in the event of intervention in the dan -
ger zone by a second person (initiated by means of a 
light curtain)
Compound safety functions are frequently employed, as 
in the example in subclause 5.7 . The movement is initi -
ally braked to a halt by the electronic drive, after which 
a mechanical holding brake is applied. The two tables 
below provide information on possible safety functions. 
Table 5.1 summarizes the safety functions according to 
subclause 5.1 of EN ISO 13849-1 and adds examples of 
possible applications. The “emergency stop function” is 
also included: though not part of a safeguard, it is used 
for implementation of a complementary protective meas-
ure (see subclause 5.5). Table 5.2 shows further safety 
functions for safe power drive systems to IEC 61800-5-2 
(PDS/SR, power drive systems/safety related) [20]. The 
scope of this standard includes the safety functions fre -
quently employed for prevention of unexpected start-up 
(safe torque off, STO), for safe stop SS1 and SS2 and for 
safely-limited speed (SLS). 
Safety functions for pneumatic drive technology are 
described in VDMA Technical Rule 24584 [21].

SSR Safe speed range The speed of the motor is kept within specified limit values.

The manner in which a safety function is executed may 
take very different forms. For this reason, certain characte -
ristics must be observed at selection, and specified on a 
case-by-case basis. These include:
•	Use in different operating modes (e.g. automatic mode, 
setup mode, troubleshooting)
•	Use of different safety functions according to whether 
the power supply is available or has failed (see also 
subclause 4.3 of [22])
•	Response(s) to tripping of the safety function
•	Response(s) to detection of a fault in the safety function
•	Response time
•	Frequency of actuation
•	Priority, in cases where several safety functions may be 
active simultaneously•	Specification of safety-related parameters, such as the 
maximum permissible speed
•	Required Performance Level PLr
Detailed information on the definition of safety functions 
can be found in SISTEMA Cookbook 6, “Definition of 
safety functions: what is important?” [23].
5.3.2 Examples in which the definition of the 
safety function has an influence upon 
subsequent calculation of the PFHD
Later chapters will show how the average probability of 
a dangerous failure per hour ( PFHD) can be calculated for 
a safety function. The foundation for this is however laid 
at this stage, with definition of the safety function. By its 
nature, the technical implementation of a safety func -
tion determines the type and scale of the components 
re quired for it. The definition of the safety function thus 
has a considerable influence upon determination of the \n315 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction
safety-related reliability. This will be explained in the fol -
lowing examples.
Example 1:  
Safety function “Stopping when the guard door is 
 opened”
When the guard door is opened, a machine operator has 
access to a danger zone in which five drives control the 
movements of machine parts. Opening the guard door 
causes all five drives to be brought to a halt as quickly as 
possible. 
When the PFHD of the safety function is calculated later, 
the PFHD values of the following blocks2 are therefore 
added:
•	Position monitoring of the guard door, including mecha -
nical components
•	Logic
•	Drives 1 to 5
The calculation may yield a PFHD that is no longer ade -
quate for the application, even though it may be that 
only drives 1 and 3 initiate hazardous movements at the 
instantaneous location of the operator, and the remaining 
drives are halted purely “functionally”. In this case, it is 
recommended that only the movements actually presen -
ting a hazard be considered for the purposes of the safety 
function, and that the safety function be reformulated in 
consideration of the drives critical to the operator‘s safety. 
The associated functional diagram is shown in Figure 5.6.
If more than one drive is involved in the hazardous 
movements in the danger zone under consideration, the 
hazards are considered overlapping. If the number of 
drives to be considered is too high, the sum of the PFHD 
values of the individual drives may once again be a total 
PFHD that is too high for the required PL of the safety 
function. The revised standard makes provision for consi -
deration of overlapping hazards. Accordingly, the hazards 
considered in the safety function in question can under 
certain circumstances be reduced to discrete hazards, i.e. 
the hazardous machine movements can be reduced to the 
movements of discrete parts of the machine. Whether this 
is possible in a given case must be determined during the 
risk assessment. Assistance in this context is provided by 
Annex J of the present report and by [24].

relevant blocks.Figure 5.6:

Example 2:  
Safety function “Stopping of the drive when a guard door 
is opened”
A hazardous movement is safeguarded by a fence with 
five guard doors. Opening any of the doors halts the 
movement. Since a person will only ever open one of the 
guard doors at once, each door constitutes a safety func -
tion in its own right, SF1 to SF5, which is composed of the 
following blocks:
•	Position monitoring of the guard door x (x = 1, 2, ...  5), 
including mechanical components
•	Logic
•	Drive

Example 3:  
Safety function “Stopping of all drives when the emer -
gency-stop device is actuated” (see subclause 5.5)
Twenty emergency-stop devices are installed on a larger 
machine; when actuated, they bring all 50 drives to a halt 
as rapidly as possible. What components must be con -
sidered in this case during implementation of the safety 
function? It cannot be predicted which of the emergency-
stop devices will be actuated in order to initiate the safety 
function. Since the user only ever actuates one emergency 
stop device at any one time, safety functions SF1 to SF20 
are defined. The location of a person exposed to a hazard 
at the time the emergency stop is initiated is not known. 
Regardless of where this person is located however, not 
all 50 drives present a hazard. The worst case should 
therefore be considered representative for all conceivable 
situations. The worst case is determined by the worst 
PFHD, and is therefore partly dependent upon the num -
ber of drives in the safety chain that generate hazardous 
movements at the least favourable location, and upon the 
respective individual PFHD values. The associated block 
diagram is shown in Figure 5.8.
The PFHD values of the following blocks must therefore be 
taken into account during subsequent calculation of the 
PFHD of the safety function:
•	Emergency stop device 03
•	Logic
•	 Drive 21
•	Drive 35
•	Drive 47

··The examples show the advantage of a “local approach” 
for definition of a safety function, in which the following 
are considered:
•	At what location are persons present at the point in time 
under analysis?
•	What movements present hazards at the location of the 
person(s)?
•	What safeguards initiate the safety function at the point 
in time under analysis? 
5.4 Determining of the required 
Performance Level PLr
A required Performance Level PLr – in technical terms, the 
desired value – must be specified for each implemented 
safety function3. The requirements are derived from the 
necessary risk reduction. During definition of the risk 
reduction, consideration must also be given to the likeli -
hood and severity of accident, which may not be known. 
ISO/TR 14121-2 [4] describes methods for determining 
the required scale of the risk reduction. EN ISO 13849-1 
employs one of these methods, that of the risk graph.
5.4.1 Risk graph
The diagram in Annex A of the standard leads directly to 
the required Performance Level PLr and is explained below 
(see Figure 5.9). Further examples of determining of the 
PLr can be found in Annex A.

3 The r (required) suffix indicates that the Performance Level in this case is that required for the safety function (desired value). 
Validation at a later stage examines whether the PL attained by the actual control system (actual value) is greater than or equal to 
the PL. In this context, “greater than” means: PL = e > PL = d > PL = c > PL = b > PL = a\n335 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction
From the starting-point, the following risk parameters are 
evaluated4: 
•	S – severity of injury
•	F – frequency of and/or duration of exposure to hazard
•	P – possibility of avoiding the hazard or of limiting the 
harm
The risk graph thus leads to the necessary PLr. This analy -
sis must be performed for each safety function and with-
out consideration of the risk reduction that is  achieved as 
a result. Where other technical measures are in place that 
are implemented independently of the control system, 
such as a mechanical guard or further safety functions, 
they can be assumed to be effective for the purpose of 
determining the PLr.
Severity of injury S1 and S2
Generally, the severity of injury (parameter S) in a hazard 
zone will be found to vary widely. For the requirements 
upon the control system however, only the following dis -
tinction is relevant:
•	S1 – slight (normally reversible injury)
•	S2 – serious (normally irreversible injury or death)
The usual consequences of accidents and the normal 
healing processes must be taken into account for deter -
mining between S1 and S2.
Frequency of and/or exposure to the hazard F1 and F2 
(parameter F)
The frequency of and/or exposure to the hazard are eva-
luated as:
•	F1 – seldom to less often, and/or exposure time is short
•	F2 – frequent to continuous, and/or exposure time is 
long
Consideration is therefore given both to the number of 
interventions in the danger zone within a period and to 
the duration of presence within it. The standard assists 
decision-making by stating that where operator interven -
tions occur more frequently than once every 15 minutes, 
F2 should be selected. In all other cases, F1 is the cor -
rect choice, provided the duration of hazard exposure 
does not exceed 1/20 of the total operation time of the 
machine. During evaluation, an average value should be considered for the duration of the hazard exposure in rela -
tion to the overall time for which a machine is in use. 
For a manually charged metalworking press whose ope -
rator must reach cyclically between the dies of the press, 
F2 is clearly the appropriate choice. Conversely, for a 
machining centre that is set up once each year and then 
operates automatically, F1 will doubtless be selected. For 
evaluation of the frequency and duration of exposure to 
the hazard, cases in which the same person or different 
persons are exposed must be treated in the same way.
P – possibility of avoiding the hazard P1 and P2  
(parameter P)
At this point, an evaluation must be made of whether 
recognition and avoidance of a hazardous situation is:
•	P1 – possible under specific conditions
•	P2 – scarcely possible  
Aspects relevant to definition of this parameter include 
the physical characteristics of a machine, the qualifica -
tions of the operator, and their possible reaction. If, for 
example, the machine must be set up whilst running at 
limited speed, the parameter P1 will be the correct choice 
at the low acceleration values for setup: with the slow 
emergence of the hazards and given sufficient freedom 
of movement, the operator will be able to move out of 
the hazard zone. Conversely, P2 must be selected when 
higher speeds may rapidly be reached and the operator 
has no realistic chance of evading an accident. During this 
evaluation, consideration should be given only to hazard 
limitation by physically possible means, and not to limi -
tation by control components, since the latter could fail 
in the event of a fault. For example, rollers moving in the 
direction of the operator‘s hand cannot entrap it under 
fault-free conditions. In the event of a control-system 
fault, however, the direction of rotation could be rever -
sed, and under worst-case conditions, the hand would be 
drawn in.
A further factor influencing determining of the PLr is the 
probability of the occurrence of a hazardous event ([3], 
5.5.2.3.2). Human behaviour and technical failure may be 
factors in this context. Both are difficult to estimate nume -
rically. The standard states the following example criteria 
however:
•	Reliability data
•	History of accidents on comparable machines
4 The probability of a hazardous event occurring is analysed in conjunction with the risk parameter P .\n345 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction
Where factors exist that enable the probability of a hazar -
dous event occurring to be deemed “low”, the PLr may 
be reduced by one level; it must however not drop below 
PL a.
What reasoning may now be given for a “low” ranking? 
Consideration of reliability data refers (among other 
aspects) to the process-related (i.e. not safety-related) 
control system. The machine manufacturer must there -
fore assess for this purpose whether high reliability of 
the components (high MTTF , in this case without “D”) 
can also be assumed for his machine. How great is there -
fore the probability for example that a standard PLC for 
functional control of a machine will incorrectly initiate 
unexpected start-up of a drive? How should new compo -
nents be evaluated that have good MTTF  values but with 
which practical experience has not yet been gained? Are 
the conditions of use of PLCs and associated components 
(sensors, frequency inverters, power supplies, etc.) com -
parable with the usual applications? What are the charac -
teristics of the supply network? Could there be elevated 
electromagnetic interference at the machine‘s planned 
location of use? What are the prevailing temperatures? 
Etc. Factors such as these may increase the probability 
of failure, even if the specified limits of the components 
used are not violated. The possibility further exists of 
errors in the software, which of course may also give rise 
to hazardous events.
Where the incidence and severity of accidents on compa -
rable machines with identical risks, the same operating 
and safety concept and identical safeguards is known and 
is considered low, the probability of a hazardous event 
occurring can also be ranked as low. 
The PLr reduced as a result of these considerations must 
not under any circumstances be lower than that of the 
machines considered by way of comparison, since it does 
not follow from a low incidence and severity of accidents 
that the level of safety provided by the implemented 
safety functions is greater than that required. It cannot be 
predicted whether a reduction of the existing level would 
lead to an unacceptable increase in the incidence and 
severity of accidents.
Chapter 6 describes the subsequent design of the safety 
functions.
5.5 Complementary protective measures
The requirements for complementary protective measures 
are contained in EN ISO 12100 [3], subclause 6.3.5. With 
regard to the control technology issues addressed in this 
report, these complementary protective measures parti -
cularly include:•	Measures for stopping in an emergency
•	Reversal of movements
•	Isolation and energy dissipation  
According to the definition, these do not constitute tech -
nical protective measures the implementation of which 
would require a certain Performance Level. These com -
plementary protective measures should however take 
effect when technical protective measures (guards and/
or protective devices) have failed or have been defeated. 
In these cases in particular, an emergency stop function 
for example is expected actually to be serviceable. The 
requirements placed by IEC 60204-1 [25] upon control 
circuits and the control functions of machines should 
therefore be observed. subclause 9.4, “Control functions 
in the event of failure”, requires an appropriate level of 
safety performance, which must be defined by the risk 
evaluation of the machine. Ultimately, the requirements 
of EN ISO 13849 therefore also apply to these comple -
mentary protective measures. Under no circumstances 
may complementary protective measures influence the 
function and standard of safeguards.
5.6 Treatment of legacy machinery
Legacy machinery in this context refers to machines that 
were placed on the market before the Machinery Directive 
came into force. The requirements of the directive were 
not applied to these machines. However, its application 
may become necessary should legacy machines be exten -
ded, modified, modernized, etc. In such cases, it must 
be assessed whether an essential change has occurred. 
Should this be the case, the requirements of the EC 
Machinery Directive apply to “old”, i.e. legacy machines 
in the same way as to new machinery. These requirements 
include the application of EN ISO 13849. An interpretation 
paper produced by the German Federal Ministry of Labour 
and Social Affairs (BMAS) assists in determining whether 
an essential change has occurred [21].
5.7 Risk reduction with reference to the 
example of a paper-cutting guillotine 
with diverse redundancy in the logic 
control (Category 4 – PL e)
The example in this subclause illustrates the application 
of EN ISO 13849-1 on a paper-cutting guillotine. Only 
certain aspects will be considered in detail, and not the 
entire process.
Paper-cutting guillotines (see Figure 5.10) are used to cut 
stacks of paper sheets or similar materials by means of a 
knife. The product to be cut is generally placed under the 
knife by hand. Immediately before the cutting action is 
performed, a clamping bar is lowered at high force onto \n355 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction
ESPE
THC

Paper cutting guillotine with two-hand 
control (THC) and electro-sensitive  
protective equipment (ESPE)
the stack in order to hold it in place during cutting. The 
knife and the clamping bar are driven hydraulically.
5.7 .1 Definition of the limits of the machine
Space limits
Since paper-cutting guillotines are charged manually, 
sufficient space is required for the handling of product 
for cutting, onward transport and storage of the cut paper 
stack, and disposal of paper waste, as well as sufficient 
space for the operator to move.
Time limits
Depending upon the application, the machine may be 
used for a period of approximately 20 years. Component 
wear may lengthen the time required for a movement to 
stop. The resulting violation of the overrun must therefore 
be detected and must result in the machine being stop -
ped.
Use limits
The intended use of the machine is that of cutting  stacked 
sheets of paper or similar materials. The machine is 
 charged manually by a single person. Depending upon 
the site of installation and the width of the machine, how -
ever, the presence of other persons in the vicinity cannot 
be excluded.The following operating modes are implemented:
1. Pressing
2. Manual cutting (single cut)
3. Automatic sequence of cuts (automatic process 
 following the first, manual cut)
4. Knife change
In the first three operating modes, movement of the clam -
ping bar alone is possible, in order for the line of cut to 
be indicated. For this purpose, the operator operates a 
pedal, and is able at the same time to alter the position 
of the paper stack with his or her hands within the danger 
zone.
5.7 .2 Identification of the hazards
The following mechanical hazards are significant for a 
paper-cutting guillotine:
•	G1 – crushing by the clamping bar
•	G2 – cutting by the knife during the cutting process
•	G3 – cutting by the knife in the rest position
Risk estimation
The dynamic press force of the clamping bar (hazard G1) 
is sufficiently great to cause not only reversible crushing 
injuries, but also broken bones. For hazard G2, amputa -
tion of limbs must be assumed. During manual positio -
ning of the paper stack, hazard G3 may lead to injury to 
the hands or forearms on the stationary knife. These inju -
ries are however generally reversible.\n365 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction
The operators‘ exposure to hazard is very high, since they 
regularly (cyclically) intervene manually in the danger 
zone in the course of routine work.
The drop speeds of the clamping bar and knife (hazards 
G1 and G2) are very high, with the result that the operator 
has virtually no means of avoiding the hazard. When the 
knife is stationary (hazard G3), the operator is able to 
avoid or limit harm.
The probability of a hazardous event occurring as a result 
of technical failure is not known. The incidence and seve -
rity on comparable machines is however low; the safe-
guards implemented here are therefore evidently ade -
quate. Should the risk analysis for a safety function yield a 
higher PLr than that actually implemented on the compa -
rable machines, the PLr can in principle be reduced by one 
level. However, since the safety functions on comparable 
paper-cutting guillotines are achieved with the highest PL, 
a reduction of the PLr will not be possible in this case (see 
subclause 5.7 .4).
Risk evaluation
In consideration of all operating conditions and all possi -
bilities for operator intervention, a risk reduction is found 
to be required.
Inherently safe design
It is not possible for the dynamic press force of the clam -
ping bar and the energy of the knife to be reduced, as this 
would impair the functionality of the machine. An arrange-
ment and design of the machine that would prevent the 
operator from reaching into the danger zone is also not 
possible, since this is precisely where the operator must 
line up the stack of paper.
The following measures can however be taken:
1.   Shrouding of all points of access to the danger zone 
except on the operator side.
2.   Avoidance of sharp edges and corners.
3.   Assurance of a suitable working position and accessi -
bility of the controls.
4.   Ergonomic design of the machine.
5.   Avoidance of electrical hazards.
6.   Avoidance of hazards presented by the hydraulic 
equipment.7 .  The mechanical components for guiding the knife and 
the clamping bar are linked such that in its top rest 
position, the knife is shrouded by the clamping bar.
5.7 .3 Required safety functions
In consideration of all operating modes and all manual 
interventions, the following safety functions are required:
•	SF1 – STO (safe torque off), for avoidance of unexpected 
start-up
•	SF2 – Controlled location of the operator‘s hands out -
side the danger zone during a hazardous movement
•	SF3 – Detection of intervention by further persons in the 
danger zone by means of ESPE (electro-sensitive pro -
tective equipment), e.g. a light curtain, and immediate 
interruption of the cutting operation
•	SF4 – Automatic stopping of all movements following 
each individual cut or following completion of the auto -
matic cutting sequence
•	SF5 – Reduction of the dynamic press force for the clam -
ping bar during the “indicate cut” function
•	SF6 – Automatic return of the clamping bar and knife to 
their initial positions following interruption of a cutting 
operation
Note: The principle of overlapping hazards could be 
applied to the machine parts of knife and clamping bar 
(see subclause 5.3.2). In this case, SF1, SF3, SF4 and SF6 
would be divided up such that dedicated safety functions 
would be defined separately for the knife and the clam -
ping bar. In the present case however, this division is not 
made, since owing to the low number of components in 
SF1 to SF6, the required PFHD can still be attained when 
these safety functions are grouped.
Characteristics of the safety functions
The cut must be interrupted immediately should the light 
curtain be penetrated. The safety function SF3 therefore 
takes priority over SF2. For SF5, the maximum permissible 
force for the clamping bar during the “indicate cut” func -
tion must be specified (see [27]).
5.7 .4 Determining of the required 
 Performance Level PLr
The PLr must be determined for each safety function. If 
the situations in which the individual safety functions are 
used are analysed, evaluation of the risk parameters S, 
F and P is seen to be similar for the safety functions SF1 to 
SF6: \n375 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction
•	S2 – serious, generally irreversible injury
•	F2 – continuous presence in the danger zone; the fre -
quency is therefore greater than once every 15 minutes
•	P2 – evasion of a hazardous situation is virtually impos -
sible
In accordance with the risk graph in Figure 5.9, this 
evaluation yields a required Performance Level PLr of e. 
The incidence and severity of accidents on comparable 
 machines is low. The safety functions considered here of these machines have already been implemented with 
PL e, as specified in [28]. The result of the risk analysis is 
therefore confirmed by the situation in practice; a possi -
ble reduction in the PLr is not indicated. Figure 5.11 shows 
the documentation and risk graph in the SISTEMA soft -
ware application for the SF1 safety function.
An adequate risk reduction has been achieved for the 
hazard G3, “Cutting by the knife in the rest state”, by 
mechanical coupling of the knife and the clamping bar. 
A safety function is not required.

Documentation and risk graph for SF1  
\n385 Safety functions and their contribution to risk reduction
5.7 .5 Complementary protective measures
The following measures are required:
1. Emergency stop
Suitable safety functions with a PL of e are already 
available in the machine control system and are used 
for the emergency stop. Provided the emergency-stop device features a two-channel circuit, stopping in an 
emergency therefore also satisfies a PL of e.
2. Freeing of a trapped person requires a reverse move -
ment of the knife and clamping bar; this is achieved by 
spring force.\n396 Design of safe control systems
 
Changes with respect to the second edition  
(BGIA Report 2/2008e): 
•	Further information added in subclause 6.1.2 (Syste -
matic failures) on application-specific integrated cir -
cuits (ASICs), field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), 
programmable logic modules and complex standard 
mo dules. subclause 6.1.3 (Ergonomics) brought into 
line with the new 2006/42/EC Machinery Directive.
•	Recommendations added to subclause 6.2.5 (Cate -
gory 2) for interpretation of the requirements for a 
Category 2.
•	Clarification added in subclauses 6.2.5 (Category 
2) and 6.2.14 ( DC) that up to a PLr of c, providing a 
warning is a permissible alternative under certain 
circumstances to initiation of a safe state. In addition, 
testing immediately upon demand of the safety func -
tion added as an alternative to testing being at least 
100 times as frequent as the demand of the safety 
function. If the safety function is tested only 25 times 
as frequently as a demand is made upon it, this can 
be estimated on the safe side by multiplication of the 
PFHD with the factor of 1.1. In addition, the requirement 
for the quality of the test equipment in Category 2 now 
refers to the MTTFD of the test channel (instead of only 
of the “TE” block) in relation to the MTTFD of the func -
tional channel (instead of only of the “L” block). 
•	“Encapsulated subsystem” introduced in subclauses 
6.2.9 and 6.4. 
6.1 Introduction
Once the precise safety function and its required risk 
reduction in the form of the PLr have been defined, 
design proper begins of the safety-related parts of the 
control system (SRP/CS) that are to carry out the safety 
function(s). The corresponding subclause from the 
iterative design process of EN ISO 13849-1 is shown in 
Figure 6.1 (see Page 40).•	Raising of the MTTFD capping in Category 4 to 
2,500 years added in subclause 6.2.13 (FMEA vs. parts 
count method). 
•	Explanations of the test rate revised and information 
on components with DC < 60% down to DC = 0% added 
in subclause 6.2.14 (diagnostic coverage). 
•	New subclause 6.2.17 added on alternative determi -
ning of the PFHD for the output part of the SRP/CS in 
accordance with subclause 4.5.5 of the standard. 
•	The previous subclause 6.2.17 (Bus systems as “inter -
connecting means”) becomes subclause 6.2.18 as a 
result.
•	Subclause 6.3.10 concerning requirements for SRESW 
for standard components brought into line with the 
new subclause 4.6.2 of the standard. Reference to IFA 
Report 2/2016 concerning safety-related application 
software for machinery also added.
•	Summation of PFHD values stated as the new standard 
procedure in subclause 6.4 (Combination of SRP/CSs 
as subsystems); tabular method for downgrading of the 
PL according to the number of subsystems degraded to 
the status of an alternative solution for the event that 
PFHD values are not available for subsystems.
•	Example of the paper-cutting guillotine in subclause 
6.5 updated.
•	References to SISTEMA Cookbooks 1, 4 and 6 as sour -
ces of further information added.
The safety-related quality of the SRP/CS is indicated by 
one of five Performance Levels (PLs). Each of these PLs 
corresponds to a range of the probability of a dangerous 
failure per hour (Table 6.1, Page 40). In addition to the 
average probability of a dangerous failure per hour ( PFHD), 
further measures, for example to enhance software 
robustness or to counter systematic failures, are required 
in order for the corresponding PL to be attained.i\n406 Design of safe control systems

d ≥ 10-7 to < 10-6
e ≥ 10-8 to < 10-7
In principle, any method (e.g. Markov  calculations, Petri 
nets) may be used to prove the probability of failure. The 
following criteria must however always be observed:
•	Quantifiable aspects (structure, component reliability, 
diagnostics in the form of tests, common cause failure)
•	Non-quantifiable, qualitative aspects that influence 
the behaviour of the SRP/CS (behaviour of the safety 
function under fault conditions, safety-related software, 
systematic failures and environmental conditions)
For both groups of criteria, EN ISO 13849-1 proposes 
practical methods that produce a good and scientifically 
sound estimate of the attained PL. For each specific sub-
aspect, proof can be made coarser or finer as required, 
permitting both a fast approximation and a more detailed 
determination.
The development procedure is first described (see sub -
clause 6.1.1). This includes requirements upon the speci -
fication and upon the documentation within the life cycle of the SRP/CS. It is followed by measures necessary for 
the control of systematic failures (subclause 6.1.2) and 
ergonomic design aspects (subclause 6.1.3). Subclause 
6.2 describes the Categories and the simplified method 
based upon them for evaluation of the quantifiable 
aspects. Subclause 6.3 then presents requirements 
upon the software. Finally, subclause 6.4 shows which 
quantifiable aspects must be considered when SRP/CSs 
are used in combination. Figure 6.2 explains the need 
for this additional subclause. The machine control sys -
tem (CS) as a whole is divided into safety-related parts 
(SRP/CS) and the non-safety-related parts; the latter are 
generally substantially more comprehensive and serve 
only to perform normal operating functions. The combi -
nation of safety-related parts of a control system begins 
at the point at which safety-related signals are generated 
(these include, for example, the actuating cam and rol -
ler of a position switch), and ends at the outputs of the 
power control elements (for example including the main 
contacts of a contactor). Where hazards do not arise in 
the de-energized state (closed-circuit current principle, 
de-energization principle), power components such 
as motors or cylinders are not regarded as an SRP/CS. 
Should external forces take effect, however (for instance 
on vertical axes), the power elements must be reenforced 
for functional safety (e.g. non-return valve on cylinders; 
supplementary mechanical brakes). Finally, subclause 6.5 
takes up the content of subclause 5.7 by describing actual 
implementation with reference to the practical example of 
the control system of a paper-cutting guillotine.\n416 Design of safe control systems

6.1.1 Design and development process
The objective of each activity during the design and inte-
gration of the safety-related parts of control systems 
(scope of the standard) is the development and use as 
intended of products that are as free of faults as possible 
and that satisfy the requirements. The objective is after 
all the health of human beings and the avoidance of acci -
dents. The motto for the design and development process 
must therefore be: “Structured and well documented”.
The process of risk reduction in accordance with 
EN ISO 12100 [3] must be geared to the entire life 
cycle of a machine, as shown in Figure 6.3. Although 
EN ISO 13849-1 contains no explicit provision to this 
effect, the concept of the life cycle must also be taken up 
during design and integration of one or more SRP/CSs, 
in order for the activities to be structured appropriately. 
The description of the standard in Chapter 4 also shows 
clearly that the iterative process described in the standard 
for the design of the safety-related parts of control sys -
tems is a process subdivided into individual phases. As 
can be seen in Figure 6.3, the validation phase is charac -
terized by structured procedures of its own. These will be 
discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7 . Structuring into 
life-cycle phases is characterized very comprehensively 
by the V model employed during development of safety-
related software; this is explained in subclause 6.3. For 
example, although the maintenance phase is not expli -
citly addressed by the design process for the SRP/CS, it 
is taken into account by the required content of the infor -
mation for use.
Since an SRP/CS constitutes parts of a machine, requi -
rements in virtually any phase of the machine's life cycle 
may also have an influence upon an SRP/CS. All phases in the machine's life cycle must therefore be considered 
during identification of the safety functions and defini -
tion of their characteristics. In order for this process to be 
organized as comprehensibly and verifiably as possible, 
safety functions are first specified. SISTEMA Cookbook 
6 [23] addresses this topic in detail: “Definition of the 
safety functions: what is important?”. An SRP/CS that is 
not developed for a specific machine control system – 
examples include light curtains or safety PLCs – therefore 
requires a particularly precise description of their charac -
teristic data and their interfaces in order for proper use to 
be assured.
The life cycle of the SRP/CS begins with specification of 
the safety functions. Besides particular aspects of various 
safety functions, EN ISO 13849-1 also lists general aspects 
that are a minimum requirement in such a specification.
A specification of this kind sets out, at the beginning of 
the design process, the framework for all parties involved. 
It constitutes a set of requirements specifications; in no 
way is it a product specification produced post-develop -
ment. A safety function is implemented by the SRP/CS 
that is part of the machine control system and that pos -
sesses interfaces to further SRP/CSs and to the functional 
control system. A specification must therefore be drawn 
up. Box 6.1 (Page 43) shows a general arrangement tem -
plate for a specification of the safety requirements. The 
arrangement also includes the specification of the safety 
functions. This arrangement template refers to the SRP/CS 
that executes the entire safety function. Where the  
SRP/CS takes the form of subsystems, the specification 
must be suitably adapted.\n426 Design of safe control systems

In order to be valid, such a specification must be veri -
fied prior to the next design step. Verification primarily 
concerns completeness, correctness, intelligibility and 
freedom from contradictions. It is clearly advantageous 
for verification to be performed, for example by way of an 
inspection, by a party not involved in the project. If safety-
related software is employed, this safety requirements 
specification must form the basis for a dedicated software 
specification (see subclause 6.3.2).
The specification is the first document to be created in 
the procedure for the design of the SRP/CS. The docu -
mentation is of great importance in the interests of veri -
fiable development. It must be considered that the task 
of updating a product may lie with a party other than the 
original designer. Details concerning the necessary docu -
mentation in the context of the iterative design process of 
the SRP/CS can be found in subclause 6.3.8 concerning 
software, and in subclauses 7 .1.4 ff. The reader is remin -
ded at this point that the documents must be unambi -
guously identifiable; version management is therefore 
essential. The contents of the information for use are ulti -
mately of major importance for the proper implementa -
tion of safety functions. EN ISO 13849-1, Clause 11 lists the 
minimum items of information that must be included in 
the information for use. The content of the manufacturer's 
internal technical documentation for the SRP/CS is listed 
in clause 10 of the standard. Requirements concerning 
the documentation are also set out in legislation. Box 
6.2 shows the content of the technical documentation for machines required in accordance with the European 
Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC [2].
6.1.2 Systematic failures
In contrast to random component failures, systematic 
failures have causes that can be eliminated only by modi -
fication for example of the design, the manufacturing 
process, the operating methods or the documentation. 
They arise at some point in the life cycle of a product, for 
example as a result of errors in the specification or the 
design, or during modification of the SRP/CS. The imple -
mentation of multi-channel structures and analysis of the 
probability of component failures are important elements 
in the design of safety technology. Should fundamental 
aspects not be considered, even the most favourable 
figures for the probability of failure are of no benefit. If, for 
example, a product is not used correctly or is used in the 
wrong environment, a risk of systematic failure may exist. 
This fact is addressed by EN ISO 13849-1 in conjunction 
with Part 2, when it requires that possible systematic 
failures also be considered for attainment of a PL. Essen -
tially, it can be said that many of the basic and well-tried 
safety principles are already effective in preventing syste -
matic failures (see Annex C). These principles, which sup -
plement Annex G of the standard, should be considered 
in accordance with EN ISO 13849-2.
The informative Annex G of the standard contains a list of 
measures, and therefore indirectly also of influences that 
are to be considered. The measures are divided into those\n456 Design of safe control systems
Box 6.2: Technical documentation for machines: excerpt from the Machinery Directive (2006/42/EC), Annex VII, A
1. The technical file shall comprise the following:
 a)   a construction file including:
  — a general description of the machinery,
  —  the general drawing of the machinery and drawings of the control circuits, as well as the pertinent   
  descriptions and explanations necessary for understanding the operation of the machinery,
  — full detailed drawings, accompanied by any calculation notes, test results, certificates, etc., required  
  to check the conformity of the machinery with the essential health and safety requirements,
  — the documentation on risk assessment demonstrating the procedure followed, including:
   i)  a list of the essential health and safety requirements which apply to the machinery,
   ii) the description of the protective measures implemented to eliminate identified hazards or to   
       reduce risks and, when appropriate, the indication of the residual risks associated with the machinery,
  — the standards and other technical specifications used, indicating the essential health and safety  
  requirements covered by these standards,
  — any technical report giving the results of the tests carried out either by the manufacturer or by a body  
  chosen by the manufacturer or his authorised representative,
  — a copy of the instructions for the machinery,
  — where appropriate, the declaration of incorporation for included partly completed machinery and  
  the relevant assembly instructions for such machinery,
  — where appropriate, copies of the EC declaration of conformity of machinery or other products incorporated  
  into the machinery,
  — a copy of the EC declaration of conformity.
 b) for series manufacture, the internal measures that will be implemented to ensure that the machinery remains  
 in conformity with the provisions of this Directive.
for the avoidance of failures (G.3 and G.4) and those for 
their control (G.2). Figure 6.4 provides an overview. The 
measures for the avoidance of failures must be effective 
throughout all phases of a product's lifetime, and are 
addressed accordingly to some degree in Chapter 7 of 
this report, under the aspect of validation. Although not 
stated explicitly, appropriate care must be taken not 
least during modifications, troubleshooting and main -
tenance. It is during these phases in particular that the 
details of development are not (or are no longer) evident. 
Conversely, measures for the control of failures must be 
implemented within a product, and take full effect during 
operation. Besides basic requirements, the standard also 
lists measu  res for selection, one or more of which are to 
be applied in consideration of the complexity of the  
SRP/CS and of the PL (marked “in addition” in Figure 6.4).
Most of the measures are explained briefly in the stan -
dard. Attention is drawn to the fact that in the day-to-day 
activities of the IFA, diversity is assumed to be of major 
benefit in general, and not only as shown for hardware in 
Figure 6.4 (see Page 46). Refer in this context also to the 
information in subclause 6.3.10 concerning the require -
ments upon software.
Should application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs), 
field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable 
logic modules or similar be used, attention is drawn to 
Annex F of IEC 61508-2:2010, which lists design and deve-lopment techniques and measures for the avoidance of 
systematic failures.
Particular care must be taken where complex standard 
components are used. Should software be involved, the 
standard provides relevant information; refer in this con -
text to subclause 6.3.10 of the present report. Manufactu -
rers of standard components take only limited measures 
for fault avoidance in a safety context. The user must 
therefore concentrate on the measures for the control 
of systematic failures. Should for example two standard 
PLCs be used in two-channel structures, an overvoltage 
in the power supply could give rise to a systematic failure 
despite redundancy (including diverse redundancy). 
Systematic failure can be prevented in such cases only 
by additional measures.The astute reader of this report 
may wonder in what way these measures differ from those 
against common cause failure (CCF, see subclause 6.2.15). 
Common cause fail ures are of course also to be regar -
ded as systematic fail ures. The analysis of CCF however 
addresses only structures that are multi-channel in form 
or that at least possess test equipment (Categories 2, 3 
and 4). A further difference is the “attempt” to consider 
CCF aspects numerically (quantitatively); by contrast, the 
analysis described in Annex G of the standard is purely 
qualitative. Given adequate measures against systematic 
failures in accordance with Annex G of the standard and 
observance of basic and well-tried safety principles, it\n466 Design of safe control systems

would not appear particularly difficult to satisfy the 
 requirements for measures against common cause failure 
(CCF).
Three examples will show that actual requirements may 
indeed vary according to application and technology, and 
that the general requirements may therefore also require 
interpretation on occasion.
Example 1:  
Measures for control of the effects of a power failure
The design of safety-related parts of control systems 
must also give consideration to faults in the power sup -
ply (electric power, air pressure in pneumatic systems, 
hy draulic fluid pressure) (see subclause 5.2.8 and Annex 
G of the standard). Voltage breakdown, voltage fluctua -
tions and overvoltage or undervoltage may for example 
endanger the safe state of a machine. This particularly 
applies to the holding of loads in a raised position by 
means of electrical and hydraulic drives (vertical axes). 
Such disturbances may be caused by component faults 
within the SRP/CS. In this case, their effects upon the Per -
formance Level are considered during verification. Should 
however the cause lie in the mains supply, or should the 
mains disconnecting device (main switch) of the machine 
have been actuated, these cases lie beyond the scope 
of quantitative analysis. They can be considered only as systematic failures – and in some cases even as operating 
states – that must be controlled by the SRP/CS such that 
the safe state is achieved and/or maintained. Since its 
third edition, the standard proposes that different safety 
functions be provided for these scenarios:
a) Where power is available
b) Where power is not available
If it is assumed that power is normally available, assess -
ment of the risk parameters for the two safety functions 
to EN ISO 13849-1 may yield different results. In individual 
caes, this may – depending upon the actual risk para-
meters – enable safety functions to be implemented with 
a lower PLr in cases where power is not available.
Example 2:  
Failure of pneumatic or hydraulic valves
Among the requirements of EN ISO 13849-2, Tables B.1 
“Basic safety principles” and B.2 “Well-tried safety prin -
ciples” for pneumatic systems are that attention must 
be paid to the “use of suitable materials and adequate 
manufacturing” and the “proper avoidance of contami -
nation of the fluid” during the design and manufacture 
of pneumatic components. These requirements apply 
above all to the selection of materials and the processes 
of manufacture and treatment in consideration of factors \n476 Design of safe control systems
such as stresses, durability, abrasion, wear, corrosion 
and temperature, and the consideration of highly effective 
filtration of the compressed air and the removal of solids 
and water. The requirements upon hydraulic components 
are specified in a similar manner in Tables C.1 and C.2. 
Here too, attention must be paid to “sufficient avoidance 
of contamination of the fluid” and “correct dimensioning 
and shaping”.
Greater resistance to operating movement may neverthe-
less arise in fluid power components that are operated 
infrequently, owing to their design features (gap between 
the valving element and the enclosure):
•	On pneumatic valves with soft seals that remain in the 
same switching position for a longer period, the seals 
may swell owing to chemical influences caused by the 
lubricant (oil with additives in the compressed air, int -
roduced by the compressor, lubricator, or lubrication for 
life), or the lubricating film may collapse under the pres -
sure of the seal edge, resulting in increased resistance 
to operation.
•	On hydraulic valves, silting may occur when the valve 
remains in the same switching position for a longer 
period. In this case, fine dirt particles are deposited in 
the sealing gap between switching cycles, causing the 
valving element to stick.
For these reasons, a high force surplus (e.g. spring force) 
must generally be engineered for return of the valving ele -
ment to the “safety-oriented switching position”. On non-
mechanical springs, retention of the reset function must 
be assured by suitable measures. In addition, the effects 
described above must be prevented by cyclical switching, 
to which the standard now refers. Failures caused by the 
absence of switching are to be prevented by suitable swit -
ching cycles/test cycles at intervals for example of less 
than eight hours.
Example 3:  
Separation of safety-related and non-safety-related 
 functions
Standards governing functional safety generally address 
the separation of safety-related functions from other 
(non-safety-related) functions. EN ISO 13849-2 is one 
such example, regarding this separation for example as a 
well-tried safety principle for electrical systems under the 
heading “Minimise possibility of faults”. This requirement 
applies to both hardware and software. At the same time, 
there may be reasons why complete separation is disad -
vantageous. In such cases, clearly defined functional and 
technical interfaces must at least be implemented that 
enable influences upon the safety-related part to be avoi -
ded and/or controlled.This requirement is illustrated well by the example of 
the development of application software. The most far-
reaching form of separation between standard applica -
tion software and safety-related application software 
(SRASW, see subclause 6.3) is of course for them to be 
written with separate programming systems (engineering 
suites) and run on separate PLCs. For economic reasons in 
particular, however, it is desirable for the entire applica -
tion software to be written by means of a single program -
ming system, possibly in the same engineering process. 
Numerous aspects must however be considered when 
this approach is followed. These include the requirement 
that safety-related variables, results or outputs must not 
be overwritten by non-safety-related parts of software 
(program, function block, function/instruction, etc.). 
Links between the two environments are permissible, 
but only with the observance of specified conventions. 
One such convention is that safety-related signals and 
functions must always retain priority: linking by means of 
an OR operation, for example, is not permitted under any 
circumstances. Modern software development tools sup -
port such approaches, and specified functions and rules 
with automatic checking have been implemented in their 
editors and compilers. Errors in logic operations, which 
may have an effect only in unpredictable operational situ -
ations and which may not be detectable with reasonable 
effort during acceptance/commissioning, can thus be 
prevented in a user-friendly manner.
This does not mean that the designer is spared a com -
plete analysis of the influence exerted by functional 
standard components of a control system upon its safety-
related parts (including the influence of the safety-related 
functions upon each other); the analysis of where (tech -
nically) and how (functionally) such influences may arise 
is however considerably simplified and accelerated by the 
use of the development tools referred to above. The even 
more pertinent question, namely how to eliminate (avoid 
or control) influences that are detected, may not even 
arise.
6.1.3 Ergonomics
Annex I, subclause 1.1.6 of the European 2006/42/EC 
Machinery Directive requires requires manufacturers of 
machines to reduce, at the design stage of the machine, 
the discomfort, fatigue and psychological stress faced by 
the operator to the greatest possible extent, taking into 
account ergonomic principles. This therefore also applies 
to the interfaces between operators of a machine/ins -
tallation and the SRP/CS. These interfaces include both 
the safeguards themselves, such as a guard door with 
position switch, and the operation of a safety function, for 
example by means of pushbuttons or even by a software 
display interface suitable for this purpose. A machine-
determined work rate and monitoring that requires 
lengthy concentration are also to be avoided.\n486 Design of safe control systems
The importance of ergonomic principles for  the SRP/CS, 
and the fact that the design of a machine does not always 
take account of all cases of intended use or foreseeable 
misuse of the SRP/CS, is demonstrated by the HVBG 
report on the defeating of protective devices on machi -
nery [29]. Resources and further information on the sub -
ject of defeating can be found on the www.stop-defeating.
org website.
EN ISO 13849-1 therefore requires that ergonomic prin -
ciples be applied, and lists a number of useful standards 
for this purpose in subclause 4.8. In order for designers 
of machines to be able to check the design of the human-
machine interface of the SRP/CS, the IFA has drawn up 
a checklist for ergonomic machine design. In February 
2018, this checklist was updated together with further 
documents in the form of DGUV Informative publication 
209-068/069 (formerly BGI/GUV-I 5048-1/2) [30]. Among 
the subjects addressed more specifically are: manually 
operated actuators; keyboards, (keypad) keys and input 
devices; displays; visual danger signals; and the soft -
ware ergonomics of user interfaces. VDI/VDE guideline 
3850 [31] for example serves as an aid to the user-friendly 
design of user interfaces for machines.
6.2  Quantification of the probability of 
failure
The numerical quantification of the probability of  fail ure 
required by the standard for determining of the PL, often 
referred to (including in other standards) simply as 
“quantification”, can strictly speaking never be attained 
exactly, but only by approximation with the aid of statis -
tical methods or other estimations. The main influencing 
variables that must be considered during this process 
of determination are stated; the method by which the 
probability of failure is actually determined from them 
is however at the user's discretion. Any validated and 
recognized method can be used for this purpose. Such 
methods include reliability block diagrams, fault tree 
analysis, Markov  modelling or Petri nets. Depending upon 
who determines the probability of failure, i.e. the manu -
facturer of the control system, the user of the machine, or 
a test body, preferences for and experience with different 
methods may differ. For this reason, any suitable method 
is explicitly permitted in this context.
At the same time, parties lacking prior experience in 
quantification of the probability of failure require some 
degree of support in the use of EN ISO 13849-1. This 
need was addressed by the development of a simplified 
approach which, whilst being based upon sound scien -
tific principles ( Markov  modelling), describes a simple 
method for quantification in successive steps. At certain 
points, the description makes estimates erring on the 
safe side which could result in a higher figure for the pro -
bability of failure being estimated than that yielded by more precise methods; the method is, however, suitable 
for practical application even by non-mathematicians, 
and the procedure is largely transparent and therefore 
verifiable. This simplified method is presented below 
in detail, both in general terms and with reference to a 
calculated practical example (see subclause 6.5). Further 
details on selected specific subjects can be found in the 
annexes.
6.2.1 Designated architectures...
The structure or architecture of a safety-related control 
system determines its tolerance of faults, and constitutes 
the framework upon which all other quantifiable aspects 
are based, by which the PL of the safety-related parts 
of control systems is ultimately formed. The experience 
gained by the IFA in conjunction with industry since 1985 
confirms that the greater part of all implemented controls 
can be assigned to a very small number of basic types 
of safety-related control systems (or to combinations of 
these basic types, see below). These types are: at one end 
of the spectrum, the single-channel untested system with 
components of differing reliability; in the middle of the 
spectrum, the same type, but enhanced by testing; and 
at the other end, the two-channel systems featuring high-
quality testing. Systems with more than two channels and 
other “exotic” structures are extremely rare in machine 
construction, and the simplified method is of only limi -
ted use for their assessment. Even where more than two 
channels are present, however, it is generally sufficient 
for the two most reliable channels to be considered in 
order for the PL to be estimated with sufficient precision 
by means of the simplified method involving designated 
architectures. Systems employing more than two chan -
nels are not therefore considered in EN ISO 13849-1. 
 SISTEMA Cookbook 4 [32] provides support in some of 
these cases: “When the designated architectures don't 
match”. In addition to the “horizontal” division into dif -
ferent functional or test channels, a “vertical” division 
into a sensor level (input devices, “I”), a processing level 
(logic, “L”) and an actuator level (output devices, “O”) is 
generally also advantageous.
Continuity is assured, fully intentionally, to the Categories 
set out in EN 954-1, which are established in the machine 
construction industry and in the associated standards. 
In accordance with this system, EN 954-1 defines five 
structures as Categories. EN ISO 13849-1 supplements 
the former Category definition slightly with quantitative 
requirements for the component reliability ( MTTFD), the 
diagnostic coverage of tests ( DCavg) and the resistance 
to common cause failures (CCF). In addition, it maps the 
Categories to five basic structural types, termed “desig -
nated architectures”. The same Categories may still take 
different structural forms; the generalization which their 
mapping to the associated designated architecture repre -
sents is still permissible as an approximation within the \n496 Design of safe control systems
simplified approach, however. The number of “vertical” 
blocks (input, logic, output) in a channel is for example 
generally of little relevance to determination of the PL 
from a mathematical and safety technology perspective.
Where more complex safety functions are involved, it may 
no longer be possible to map the entire safety chain to 
any single one of the five basic types. In this case, the 
solution is generally for the safety chain to be broken 
down into several subclauses (“subsystems”), each of 
which can be mapped to a particular designated architec -
ture. The method by which these subsystems are then 
recomposed and an overall value determined from the 
individual Performance Levels is explained in greater 
detail in subclause 6.4. The following information relates 
to control systems (SRP/CS) that can be assigned to a 
Category without being broken down into subsystems. It 
can however be applied by analogy to subsystems that 
perform only a part of a safety function.
6.2.2 ... and Categories
The Categories classify safety-related parts of a control 
system (SRP/CS) with respect to their resistance to faults 
and their subsequent behaviour in the fault condition, 
based upon the reliability of the parts and/or their struc -
tural arrangement (see Table 6.2, see Page 50). A higher 
resistance to faults translates into a greater possible risk 
reduction. For definition of the probability of failure and 
of the PL, the Categories therefore form the backbone, 
complemented by the component reliability ( MTTFD), the 
tests ( DCavg), and the resistance to common cause failures 
(CCF).
Category B is the basic Category, the requirements of 
which must also be met in all other Categories. In Catego -
ries B and 1, the resistance to faults is attained primarily 
by the selection and use of suitable components. The 
safety function may be rendered ineffective by the occur -
rence of a fault. Category 1 has a greater resistance to 
faults than Category B owing to the use of special compo -
nents and principles that are well-tried for safety applica -
tions.
In Categories 2, 3 and 4, superior performance in terms of 
the specified safety function is attained primarily by struc -
tural measures. In Category 2, performance of the safety 
function is generally checked automatically at regular 
intervals by self-tests performed by technical test equip -
ment (TE). The safety function may fail however should a 
fault arise between the test phases. By appropriate selec -
tion of the test intervals, a suitable risk reduction can 
be attained with application of Category 2. In Categories 3 and 4, the occurrence of a single fault does not result 
in loss of the safety function. In Category 4, and where 
reasonably practicable also in Category 3, such faults are 
detected automatically. In addition, the resistance to an 
accumulation of undetected faults is also assured in Cate -
gory 4.
Consideration of the faults must include an assessment of 
what component faults may be assumed, and what faults 
may (with reasoning) be excluded. Information on the 
faults to be considered is provided in Annex C.
In Categories 3 and 4, common cause failures capable of 
causing simultaneous failure of more than one channel 
must also be adequately controlled. The same applies to 
Category 2, since the test equipment and its dedicated 
shut-off path also constitute a second channel. Essen-
tially, it can be said that many of the basic and well-tried 
safety principles are effective not only against random 
hardware failures, but also against systematic faults that 
may creep into the product at some point in the product 
life cycle, e.g. faults arising during product design or 
modification.
6.2.3 Category B
The SRP/CS must be designed, constructed, selected, 
assembled and combined for the intended application in 
accordance with the relevant standards with application 
of the basic safety principles in such a way that they can 
resist:
•	The expected operating stresses (e.g. reliability with 
respect to breaking capacity and frequency)
•	The influence of the processed material (e.g. aggressive 
chemical substances, dusts, chips)
•	Other relevant external influences (e.g. mechanical 
vibration, electromagnetic interference, interruptions or 
disturbances in the power supply)
With regard to electromagnetic compatibility (EMC), 
the standard refers to particular requirements stated in 
the relevant product standards, such as IEC 61800-3 for 
power drive systems. It emphasizes the importance of the 
require ments for immunity to interference in particular 
for the functional safety of the SRP/CS. Where no pro -
duct standard exists, the requirements of IEC 61000-6-2 
concerning immunity to interference should at least be 
ob served. Annex K contains a detailed description of EMC 
and functional safety of machinery.\n506 Design of safe control systems

These general principles can be presented, both in gene -
ral terms and with regard to specific technologies, in the 
basic safety principles listed in Annex C. The general basic 
safety principles apply in full here to all technologies, 
whereas the technology-specific principles are required in addition for the technology concerned. Since Category B 
is the basic Category underlying all other Categories (see 
Table 6.2), the basic safety principles must be applied 
generically during the design of safety-related parts of 
control systems and/or safeguards.\n516 Design of safe control systems
For components that satisfy Category B, no further special 
safety measures are required. The MTTFD of each chan -
nel may therefore be low or medium (see below for the 
definition of “low” and “medium”). Should a component 
failure occur, it may lead to loss of the safety function. 
No monitoring measures, including DCavg, are required. 
Common cause failures are also not relevant on single-
channel control systems; no requirements therefore exist 
with regard to CCF.
Owing to this very rudimentary resistance to failure, the 
maximum attainable PL of Category B systems is limited 
to PL b.
The designated architecture for Category B in Figure 6.5 
corresponds to a single-channel system with input (I), 
logic (L) and output (O) levels.

6.2.4 Category 1
In addition to satisfying the requirements for Category B, 
for example the application of basic safety principles, 
Category 1 SRP/CS must be designed and constructed 
using well-tried components and well-tried safety prin-
ciples.
A well-tried component for a safety-related application is 
a component that has been either
•	widely used in the past with successful results in similar 
applications, or
•	made and verified using principles that demonstrate its 
suitability and reliability for safety-related applications.
Annex C provides an overview of known components 
employing a range of technologies that are well-tried for 
safety applications.
Newly developed components and safety principles may 
be considered as equivalent to “well-tried” when they 
fulfil the second condition stated above. The decision to 
accept a particular component as well-tried depends on 
the application. Complex electronic components, such as 
programmable logic controllers (PLCs), microprocessors 
or application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) cannot 
generally be considered as equivalent to “well-tried”.The well-tried property of a component is dependent upon 
its application, and indicates only that a dangerous failure 
is improbable. It follows that the anticipated dangerous 
failure rate is greater than zero, and is considered in the 
form of the MTTFD during calculation of the PL. Conversely, 
the assumption of a fault exclusion (see subclause 6.2.10) 
gives rise to assumption of an “infinitely high” MTTFD that 
is not considered in the calculation.
Owing to the expected higher component reliability, the 
MTTFD of the single channel in Category 1 must be high; as 
in Category B, however, no requirements are placed upon 
the DCavg and CCF. The occurrence of a fault can lead to the 
loss of the safety function. The MTTFD of the channel in 
Category 1 is however greater than that in Category B. In 
consequence, loss of the safety function is less probable, 
and the maximum PL that can be attained with Category 1 
is PL c.
The designated architecture for Category 1 is the same as 
for Category B (see Figure 6.5), since the differences lie in 
the component reliability and not in the structure.
6.2.5 Category 2
In addition to the requirements for Category B (e.g. the 
application of basic safety principles), Category 2 SRP/CS 
must employ well-tried safety principles and be designed 
such that their safety functions are tested at reasonable 
intervals, for example by the machine control system. The 
safety function(s) must be tested:
•	at start-up of the machine, and
•	prior to initiation of any hazardous situation, e.g. the 
start of a new cycle, start of other movements, as soon 
as the safety function is required, and/or periodically 
during operation, where the risk assessment and the 
form of operation indicate that this is necessary.
These tests can be initiated automatically. Each test of the 
safety function(s) must either:
•	permit operation, if no faults have been detected, or
•	should a fault have been detected, generate an output 
for the initiation of appropriate control action (OTE). 
As a general rule, and always where PLr = d, the output 
(OTE) must initiate a safe state that is maintained until 
the fault has been eliminated. Up to PLr = c, when initia -
tion of a safe state is not practicable (for example owing 
to welding of the contacts of the final switching device), 
a sufficient alternative may be for the output of the test 
equipment (OTE) to provide only a warning.\n526 Design of safe control systems
For the designated architecture of Category 2 (Figure 6.6), 
calculation of the MTTFD and DCavg considers only the 
blocks of the functional channel (i.e. I, L and O). When the 
simplified method in the standard is used, the MTTFD of 
the blocks of the test channel (i.e. TE and OTE) is consi-
dered indirectly, since this method requires the MTTFD of 
the test channel to be at least half the MTTFD of the func -
tional channel. Values from “low” to “high” are permitted 
for the MTTFD of the functional channel. The DCavg must be 
at least “low”. Adequate measures against CCF must also 
be applied (see subclause 6.2.15 and Annex F).

Monitoring (reasonably
practicable fault detection)
The test must not itself give rise to a hazardous situation 
(e.g. owing to lengthening of the response time). The 
test equipment may be integral with or separate from the 
functional channel (see below for further information). 
Category 2 cannot be applied in some cases, since testing 
of the safety functions is not possible on all components. 
Since the safety function can fail unnoticed between 
tests, the interval between tests is a critical parameter. In 
addition, the test equipment could itself fail undetected 
before the functional channel fails. Simplified quantifica -
tion of the PL by means of the designated architecture and 
the bar chart (Figure 6.10, Page 61) is therefore subject to 
the following requirements:
•	The MTTFD value of the test channel is not lower than 
half the MTTFD value of the functional channel, and
•	The test rate is at least 100 times the mean demand 
rate upon the safety function (as an exception, at least 
25 times as high; see subclause 6.2.14) or testing is per -
formed immediately when a demand is made upon the 
safety function, and the overall time for detection of the 
fault and for bringing the machine into a non-hazardous 
state (the machine is generally stopped) is shorter than 
the time to reach the hazard (see also EN ISO 13855).
Owing to these restrictions and to the fact that with the 
designated architecture, a DCavg of over 90% is difficult to attain in practice with external test equipment, undetec -
ted first faults may result in loss of the safety function. For 
these reasons, the maximum PL that can be attained with 
Category 2 is limited to PL d.
Interpretation of the requirements for a Category 2 pre -
sents certain difficulties that can sometimes only be deci -
ded on a case-by-case basis. The following recommenda -
tions can be made in this respect:
•	The standard requires testing of the safety function. 
Should this not be possible for all components, Cate -
gory 2 cannot be applied (Note 1 in EN ISO 13849-1:2015, 
subclause 6.2.5). It thus follows that all components of 
the functional channel must be tested. The functional 
channel encompasses all components that can cause 
failure of the safety function by at least one failure  
mode. The standard specifies at least a low DCavg for the 
functional channel.
•	“Testing of the safety function” cannot always be per -
formed by testing of the functional channel from input 
to output. Ideally, it should be performed actively by 
the test equipment itself, or the test equipment should 
use components of its own to monitor execution of the 
safety function passively. In the passive solution, an 
adequate test rate must be ensured by the application. 
Alternatively, the blocks (I, L, O) or components in the 
functional channel can be monitored individually; dia -
gnostics should always be as close as possible to the 
“actual execution of the safety function”.
•	The statement that the test equipment may be integral 
with or separate from the functional channel means 
that whilst it is permissible for elements of the test 
equipment performing the test to be located within the 
functional channel, for example in an SRP/CS consisting 
of electronics, the part of the test equipment evaluating 
the diagnostic results must however normally be engi -
neered external to the functional channel, for example 
in the form of a separate watchdog. Only in this way can 
the requirements concerning mutual independence of 
the functional and test channels be satisfied. The dia -
gnostic information for the test equipment should pro -
vide adequate information on the safety-related service -
ability of the monitored parts of the functional channel. 
It must therefore exhibit a certain minimum complexity 
in order to enable the test equipment to reach a sound 
decision regarding the serviceability. Complete merging 
of TE with the functional channel is not acceptable, as 
for example in the case of an on-chip watchdog without 
the separation described in IEC 61508-2, Annex E (Spe -
cial architecture requirements for integrated circuits 
with on-chip redundancy) or test equipment that is 
engineered only in the form of software and accesses 
OTE directly by means of a de-energizing signal gene-
rated by software.\n536 Design of safe control systems
•	Subclause 6.2.14 and Annex E provide further informa -
tion, in particular on the required test rate, reliability of 
the test equipment, initiation of the test (automatically, 
manually, in response to a demand of the safety func -
tion) and diagnostics measures.
6.2.6 Category 3
In addition to the requirements for Category B (e.g. the 
application of basic safety principles), Category 3 SRP/CS 
must embody well-tried safety principles and be designed 
such that a single fault does not result in loss of the safety 
function. Whenever reasonably practicable, a single fault 
must be detected at or prior to the next demand of the 
safety function.
Values ranging from low to high may be selected for 
the MTTFD of each channel. Since not all faults need be 
detected or the accumulation of undetected dangerous 
faults may lead to a hazardous situation, a low DCavg is 
the minimum requirement. Refer to subclause 6.2.14 for 
issues relating to the test rate. Adequate measures must 
be taken against common cause failure (CCF).
The requirement of single-fault tolerance does not 
necessarily mean that a two-channel system must be 
implemented, since single-channel components with 
no potential for dangerous failure (fail-safe design), for 
example, may also be tolerant of single faults. The same 
applies to systems with a high standard of monitoring 
that respond to a fault sufficiently quickly by means of a 
dedicated shut-off path for a dangerous state to be avoi -
ded. Nevertheless, the majority of Category 3 systems are 
implemented in two-channel form. A corresponding desi -
gnated architecture was selected for this reason (Figure 
6.7). A purely “logical two-channel arrangement”, for 
example employing redundant software on single-channel 
hardware, will however not generally offer single-fault 
tolerance of hardware failures.
6.2.7 Category 4
Over and beyond the requirements for Category B (e.g. the 
application of basic safety principles), Category 4 SRP/CS 
must apply well-tried safety principles and be designed 
such that:
•	a single fault does not result in loss of the safety func -
tion, and
•	the single fault is detected at or prior to the next 
demand of the safety function, for example immedia -
tely when the machine is switched on or at the end of a 
machine operating cycle. Should such detection not be 
possible, the accumulation of undetected faults must 
not result in loss of the safety function. (In practice, Figure 6.7:

Since this is the Category with the greatest resistance to 
faults (the greatest contribution to risk reduction), both 
the MTTFD of each channel and the DCavg must be high (see 
subclause 6.2.14 for the issue of the test rate), and ade -
quate measures must be taken against CCF.
Since the differences between this Category and Category 
3 lie primarily in the MTTFD and the DCavg, the designated 
architecture for Category 4 (Figure 6.8) is similar to that for 
Category 3. The unbroken lines for monitoring symbolize 
the higher DCavg, however.

6.2.8 Blocks and channels
For simplified quantification of the probability of failure, 
presentation of the safety-related control in the form 
of abstracted blocks and channels is helpful. The term \n546 Design of safe control systems
“blocks” has a defined meaning of its own in this con -
text. It refers to function blocks only in the sense that the 
safety function is executed in smaller units arranged in 
series and in parallel. The following rules can be stated 
for mapping of the hardware structure to a safety-related 
block diagram:
•	The blocks should map, in abstract form, all control 
components that relate to performance of the safety 
function.
•	If the safety function is performed in multiple redundant 
channels, they should be presented in separate blocks.  
This reflects the fact that should one block fail, perfor -
mance of the safety function by the blocks of the other 
channel is not impaired.
•	Division of the blocks within a channel is somewhat 
arbitrary; although EN ISO 13849-1 proposes three 
blocks per channel (input level I, logic level L and output 
level O), this is primarily in the interests of clarity. Nei-
ther the precise boundary between I, L and O, nor the 
number of blocks in a channel significantly affects the 
probability of failure calculated in the form of the PL.
•	The block assignment of each hardware unit relevant 
to safety must be clearly specified, e.g. in the form of a 
parts list. This permits calculation of the mean time to 
dangerous failure ( MTTFD) of the block, based upon the 
MTTFD of the hardware units belonging to the block con -
cerned (e.g. by failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) 
or the parts count method, see subclause 6.2.13).
•	Hardware units employed purely for test purposes, 
failure of which cannot directly impair performance 
of the safety function in the various channels, may be 
grouped as a separate block. For Categories 3 and 4, 
the standard does not set out direct requirements for 
the reliability of this block; with reference to Category 
2, however, a general guideline is that its  MTTFD should 
be at least half that of the individual (symmetrized, see 
below) channel, and consideration should also be given 
to systematic failures and CCF.
6.2.9 Safety-related block diagram
The safety-related block diagram is based upon the more 
familiar reliability block diagram [33]. Common to both 
diagrams is the principle that the (safety) function may 
continue to be performed provided a chain of blocks 
that have not failed dangerously remains intact from left 
to right along the functional connecting lines. However, 
the safety-related block diagram presents additional test 
mechanisms, such as the cross monitoring of redundant 
channels, or tests performed by separate test units. A 
general example of a safety-related block diagram is 
shown in Figure 6.9.Figure 6.9:  
General example of a safety-related block diagram; I1 and O1 
constitute the first channel (series arrangement), whilst I2, L 
and O2 constitute the second (series arrangement); the safety

Subsystem 2 (SB2)SB1
In accordance with this definition, the following rules can 
be formulated for presentation of a safety-related control 
system in the form of a safety-related block diagram:
•	The arrangement of blocks in series in the form of a 
“channel” (e.g. blocks I, L and O) expresses the fact 
that failure of one block may lead to failure of the entire 
chain. Should for example a hardware unit in a channel 
fail dangerously, the entire channel becomes unable to 
execute the safety function.
•	A parallel arrangement of blocks or channels symboli -
zes the multiply redundant performance of the safety 
function, or of relevant parts of it. For example, a safety 
function performed by multiple channels is maintained 
provided at least one channel has not suffered failure.
•	Blocks employed for test purposes only, which do not 
impair performance of the safety function in the diffe -
rent channels should they fail, can be presented as a 
separate test channel. Although failure of test measures 
causes the reliability of the system as a whole to be 
reduced, the effect is initially only minor provided per -
formance of the safety function proper in the individual 
channels remains assured.
Definition of the blocks and channels goes hand-in-hand 
with determining of the Category, and is the first step 
in quantification of the PL. Further values are required 
for this purpose: the evaluation of the component reli -
ability ( MTTFD), of the tests ( DCavg), and of the relevance 
of common cause failures (CCF). Further information on 
the journey “from the conceptual schematic diagram 
to the Performance Level”, specifically, on deriving the 
safety-related block diagram, can be found in SISTEMA 
Cookbook 1 [34]. This cookbook also introduces the term 
“encapsulated subsystem”. This refers to a subsystem 
for which the manufacturer already states the PL, PFHD 
and Category, and the precise internal structure and 
para meters of which are not transparent. These stated 
parameters require observance of the conditions for use 
specified by the manufacturer, which for example may \n556 Design of safe control systems
include the implementation of external diagnostics. It is 
presented in the safety-related block diagram at subsys -
tem level in single-channel form as a circle within a block 
(see subsystem “SB1” in Figure 6.9). It contributes to 
quantification of the PL only through its parameters PFHD 
and PL; statement of the Category is merely informative.
6.2.10 Fault considerations and fault exclusion
In a real-case control system, there is no limit whatsoever 
to the number of theoretically possible faults. Evaluation 
must therefore be limited to the faults that are relevant. 
Certain faults can be excluded if the following points are 
considered:
•	The technical improbability of their occurrence (a proba -
bility that is several orders of magnitude lower than that 
of other possible faults and the risk reduction that is to 
be attained)
•	Generally accepted technical experience, irrespective of 
the application under consideration
•	The technical requirements relating to the application 
and to the specific hazard
The component faults that may occur and those that can 
be excluded are described in EN ISO 13849-2. The fol -
lowing points must be observed:
•	The fault lists constitute a selection only. Where neces -
sary, new fault models must therefore be created (for 
example for new components), or further fault types 
considered, depending upon the application. This can 
be determined for example by means of an FMEA.
•	Secondary faults are evaluated as a single fault together 
with the initial fault giving rise to them, as are multiple 
faults with a common cause (CCF, common cause fail-
ures).
•	The simultaneous incidence of two or more faults diffe -
ring in their cause is considered extremely unlikely, and 
need not therefore be taken into account.
Further information on fault exclusion can be found in 
Annex C and in Part 2 of EN ISO 13849. Should faults be 
excluded without the reason for exclusion being imme -
diately apparent (such as the peeling-off of tracks on a 
properly dimensioned circuit-board layout), precise rea-
soning must be stated in the technical documentation.
Provided the relevant conditions are met, fault exclusions 
are also possible for components, for example for the 
electrical break contacts and the mechanical actuation 
of electromechanical position switches or emergency 
stop devices. The validity of fault exclusions may be limited here to low PLs; refer for example to Table D.8 of 
EN ISO 13849-2 and Annex D of the present report. If fault 
exclusion applies, failure rates ( MTTFD) and monitoring 
measures ( DC) need not be considered for such compo -
nents.
6.2.11 Mean time to dangerous  
failure – MTTFD
The reliability of the individual components from which 
the control system is constructed makes a decisive con -
tribution to its overall reliability. The MTTFD (mean time 
to dangerous failure) is thus also considered in the PL as 
a reliability value. It is clear that “failure” in this context 
refers to component defects that result in the implemen -
ted function not or no longer being performed. The other 
parts of the term require explanation, however:
•	“Mean” indicates that the value is a statistical mean: it 
does not refer to a specific component, but is defined 
as an anticipated value for the mean lifetime of the typi -
cal component. In this context, the anticipated value for 
an individual component can be considered equal to 
the mean value of a large number of components of the 
same type. The value is not therefore a guaranteed mini -
mum lifetime in the sense of failure-free period. This 
approach employing a mean value is also reflected in 
the fact that the lifetime values are not normally adap -
ted to the conditions of use (e.g. load, temperature, 
climate), provided the components are employed within 
the conditions of use specified for them. It is generally 
assumed here that the higher load in one application 
of a device is averaged out by a lower load in another 
application. Should higher loads be anticipated in all 
applications (e.g. owing to extreme temperatures), how -
ever, these conditions must be considered when the 
MTTFD is determined.
•	“Time” indicates that the reliability is expressed in 
terms of a time in the sense of a lifetime. The MTTFD is 
generally indicated in years (abbreviated “a”). Other 
forms of notation that may be converted to an MTTFD  
include failure rates or (switching) cycles. Failure rates 
are generally indicated by the small Greek letter λ 
(lambda) and expressed in the unit “FIT” (= 10-9/h, i.e. 
failures per billion component hours). The relation -
ship between λD and MTTFD is expressed, at a constant 
fail ure rate λD over the lifetime, as MTTFD = 1/λD. The 
conversion from hours to years must of course be con -
sidered. For components that wear primarily as a result 
of their mechanical operation, the reliability is usually 
expressed in switching cycles, for example as a B10D 
value, i.e. the mean number of cycles until 10% of the 
components fail dangerously. The MTTFD can be calcula -
ted in this case by consideration of the mean number of 
operations per year nop that are anticipated in the appli -
cation concerned. For more details, refer to Annex D.\n566 Design of safe control systems
•	“Dangerous” indicates that only failures that impair 
performance of the safety function are ultimately consi-
dered for the PL (unsafe failure). By contrast, safe failu -
res may well cause the safe state to be assumed (opera -
ting inhibition) or reduce the availability or productivity 
of a machine, but the safety function is nevertheless 
executed properly, or the safe state initiated/maintai -
ned. In redundant structures, however, the “dangerous” 
attribute refers to each individual channel. Should a 
failure in one channel result in the safety function being 
rendered inoperative, the failure concerned is conside -
red dangerous, even where a further channel is still able 
to perform the safety function successfully.
An MTTFD may be stated both for an individual compo -
nent, such as a transistor, valve or contactor, and for a 
block, a channel, or the control system as a whole. This 
overall MTTFD represents the value for a channel, possibly 
symmetrized over several channels, and is based upon 
the MTTFD of all components involved in the SRP/CS. In 
accordance with the bottom-up principle, the unit under 
consideration is successively enlarged. In the interests 
of minimizing effort, it is often advantageous only for 
safety-related components to be considered in the ana -
lysis, i.e. components the failure of which could have an 
indirect or direct negative influence upon performance 
of the safety function. For simplification purposes, fault 
exclusions are possible in addition; these take account 
of the fact that certain failures are extremely improbable 
and their contribution to the overall reliability negligibly 
small. The assumption of fault exclusions is however 
subject to certain conditions; these are set out in detail 
in EN ISO 13849-2 and described more comprehensively 
in subclause 6.2.10. Conductor short circuits or certain 
mechanical failures can for example be excluded on the 
basis of the design, provided certain conditions are met.
6.2.12 Data sources for individual components
One of the questions most frequently posed in this con -
text concerns the sourcing of reliable failure data for the 
safety-related components. The manufacturer, and for 
example his technical data sheet, should be given prefe -
rence here over all other sources. Many manufacturers, 
for example of electromechanical or pneumatic com -
ponents, now make such information available. Where 
data are not available from the manufacturer, typical 
example values can still be obtained from established 
databases (see Annex D). Such sources do not generally 
distinguish between dangerous and safe failures; it can 
however be assumed as a general approximation that on 
average, only half of all failures are dangerous. With con -
sideration for the problem of obtaining reliability values, 
EN ISO 13849-1 lists a number of typical values. These 
are however very conservative estimates, and their use is 
therefore recommended only if the data sources indica -
ted above are not available. In addition to MTTFD values for mechanical, hydraulic and electronic components, 
the standard also contains B10D values for pneumatic and 
electromechanical components. Details are described in 
Annex D.
A convenient source of reliability data for components 
intended for use in safety-oriented control systems are 
the large number of available SISTEMA libraries (see 
Annex H). These contain MTTFD or B10D values for elements 
and components, and PL and PFHD values for entire sub -
systems.
6.2.13 FMEA versus the parts count method
Once the MTTFD values of all safety-related components 
have been obtained, certain simple rules can be used to 
calculate the MTTFD value of the control system from them. 
A number of methods can be used for this purpose: com -
plex, with the use of a precise failure mode and effects 
analysis (FMEA), or fast and simple by means of the parts 
count method, involving minor estimations erring on the 
safe side. This begins with the small difference between 
MTTF  and MTTFD: what proportion of failures of a certain 
component are dangerous? All conceivable failure modes 
can be listed in a complex FMEA, evaluated as either 
“safe” or “dangerous”, and the fraction of their occur -
rence estimated. Since the effects of a component failure 
upon the block determine whether the failure mode is 
safe or dangerous, detailed analyses of the effect caused 
by a failure may be necessary. A greater number of failure 
modes may then prove to be “safe” than is the case with a 
simplified assessment, as proposed by EN ISO 13849-1: if 
the parts count method is used, its conservative approach 
assumes that overall, the safe and dangerous failures are 
similar in number. In the absence of more detailed infor -
mation, the MTTFD is therefore always assumed with this 
method to be double the MTTF .
Once again, the principle is that of the statistical mean, 
i.e. an excessively favourable evaluation of one compo -
nent is cancelled out by an overly pessimistic evaluation 
of another. It is quite possible for the parts count method 
and an FMEA to be combined. Where the values produced 
by a parts count alone yield a sufficiently low PFH, an 
FMEA need not be performed. Should this not be the case, 
however, a study of the failure modes is advantageous, 
for example by means of a partial FMEA, particularly on 
the components exhibiting poorer MTTFD values. Further 
explanations of this subject can be found in Annex B.
As with other methods of quantification, evaluation to 
EN ISO 13849-1 assumes a constant failure rate through-
out the mission time of the component for all MTTFD 
values. Even if this does not directly reflect the failure 
behaviour, as for example in the case of components 
subject to heavy wear, an approximate MTTFD value that 
remains valid throughout the component's mission time \n576 Design of safe control systems
is nevertheless determined in this way by an estima -
tion erring on the safe side. Early failures are generally 
disregarded, since components exhibiting pronounced 
early failure patterns do not satisfy the availability 
re quirements for a machine control system and are there -
fore not generally significant on the market. The advan -
tage of this procedure is that the MTTFD is always equal to 
the reciprocal of the associated dangerous failure rate λD. 
Since the dangerous failure rates λD of the components in 
a block can simply be added together, the MTTFD values 
of the components involved (N components with running 
index i) give rise to the MTTFD of the block as follows:
=N
i=1MTTFDi1
MTTFD1Σ λD =N
i=1Σ λDi bzw. (1)
The same relationship applies to calculation of the MTTFD 
of each channel from the MTTFD values of the associated 
blocks. Once the MTTFD for each channel is known, a 
further simplification is made in the form of a classifica -
tion. The calculated values are assigned to three typical 
classes (Table 6.3).
Table 6.3:  
Classification of the MTTFD of each channel
MTTFD for each channel
Description Range
Not suitable 0 years ≤ MTTFD < 3 years
Low 3 years ≤ MTTFD < 10 years
Medium 10 years ≤ MTTFD < 30 years
High 30 years ≤ MTTFD ≤ 100 years
Permissible only in  
Category 4100 years < MTTFD ≤ 2,500 years
A mean (important: not guaranteed) lifetime of less than 
three years is deemed not reasonable for safety engi -
neering components. Other than for Category 4, values 
exceeding 100 years may not be substituted; this prevents 
the component reliability being overstated in compari -
son with the other main influencing variables such as 
the structure or tests. Should a figure of less than three 
years actually be produced for a channel, the components 
should be replaced with more reliable alternatives, since 
even PL a cannot otherwise be attained. Values over 
100 years for the mean lifetime are not unusual, but owing 
to “capping”, do not have any bearing upon the PL above 
this value, since the maximum value of 100 years (the 
maximum value in Category 4 is 2,500 years) is substi-
tuted in this case for the component reliability.
If several channels are involved in a control system, it 
is not initially clear which value should be employed as 
representative for the entire system. A cautious approach would of course be to take the lower value; results that 
are better whilst still being safe are however produced by 
the following averaging formula (C1 and C2 refer here to 
the two channels, which are symmetrized):
⎟
⎠⎞
+− + =
MTTFDC21
MTTFDC111MTTFDC2MTTFDC1 32MTTFD⎟
⎠⎞
(2)
Where the channels concerned are balanced, the MTTFD 
value calculated in this way corresponds to the MTTFD 
value of one channel. Where they are imbalanced, the 
result is an average MTTFD than can be no less than two-
thirds of the better value. In this scenario, the effect may 
arise in addition that the better value was previously 
capped to an MTTFD of 100 years (2,500 years in the case 
of Category 4), and as a result the symmetrized value 
is less than 100 years (2,500 years for Category 4). It is 
therefore generally more effective to implement channels 
of balanced reliability wherever possible. Irrespective of 
the number and form of the channels, this method always 
produces an MTTFD value for a single control channel 
which, averaged over the control system, indicates the 
level of component reliability.
6.2.14 Diagnostic coverage of test and  
 monitoring measures – DC
A further variable with a major influence upon the PL are 
the (self-)test and monitoring measures in SRP/CS. Effec -
tive tests for example permit some compensation to be 
made for poor reliability of the components. The quality 
of the tests is measured in EN ISO 13849-1 by the diag -
nostic coverage ( DC). The DC is defined as the proportion 
of detected dangerous failures among all conceivable 
dangerous failures. The reference quantity may be a com -
ponent, a block, or the entire SRP/CS. In the last of these 
cases, the DC is the average diagnostic coverage DCavg, 
which has an important function in the simplified quanti -
fication of the PL by means of the bar-chart method.
As at many other points in the standard, two methods 
exist for calculation of the DCavg: one more precise but 
more complex; the other simpler, involving a series of 
estimations erring on the safe side. The precise, com -
plex method involves a failure mode and effects analysis 
(FMEA) and is based upon the DC definition. In this case, 
the dangerous detectable (DD) and dangerous undetec -
table (DU) failure modes for each component are deter -
mined, together with their proportions of the total failure 
rate of the component. Finally, summation and formation 
of the ratio produces the DC value for the unit under con -
sideration:\n586 Design of safe control systems
(3)Σ λDΣ λDD=Σ λDD + Σ λDUΣ λDD=DC
The method favoured by EN ISO 13849-1 is based upon a 
reasoned conservative estimate of the DC directly on the 
component or block level, followed by calculation of the 
DCavg from the individual DC values by means of an avera -
ging formula. Many tests can be classified as typical stan -
dard measures for which estimated DC values are listed 
in Annex E of the standard. These measures are assigned 
a coarse system comprising four key values (0%, 60%, 
90% and 99%). A comprehensive list of the typical test 
measures stated in the standard can be found in Annex E. 
Application is explained with reference to the example of 
the control system of a paper-cutting guillotine (see sub -
clause 6.5).
A number of boundary conditions must be observed for 
calculation of the DC of a component or block:
•	Detection of a dangerous failure is only the beginning. 
In order for the test to be passed, a safe state that pre -
sents no further hazard must be initiated in time. This 
includes an effective shut-off path, which for example in 
the case of single-channel tested systems (Category 2) 
entails a requirement for a second shut-off element. 
This is required in order to initiate and maintain the 
safe state when the test has detected failure of the nor -
mal shut-off element (block “O” on the safety-related 
block diagram). Only where the risk is low (up to PLr = c) 
and when initiation of a safe state is not possible (for 
example owing to welding of the contacts of the final 
switching device) may it be sufficient in Category 2 for 
the output of the test equipment (OTE) only to provide 
a warning.
•	The initiation of a test, its performance, and the neces -
sary shut-off process should ideally be performed 
automatically by SRP/CS. Only in exceptional cases is 
it acceptable to rely here upon manual intervention, for 
example by the machine operator, since experience in 
practice shows that the necessary measures are often 
not adequately implemented, whether out of idleness, 
or owing to pressure of work or poor information or 
organization. Effective implementation of manual tests 
involves greater involvement in the work process, or 
greater organizational effort and discipline. Calculation 
of the DC nonetheless takes account of fault detection 
when a demand is made upon the safety function, i.e. 
consideration is not limited to tests initiated automati -
cally by programmable electronics; electromechanical 
components such as relays or contactors constitute 
classic cases in which the fault of a “failure to drop 
out” can typically be detected only when a demand is 
made upon the safety function. Where faults are to be 
detected in the event of a demand, the frequency must be considered with which a demand is made upon the 
safety function, in order to ensure an adequate test 
rate, as described in the next point.
•	A further aspect is the question of the necessary test 
rate. A test that is not executed sufficiently frequently 
may under certain circumstances be overtaken by the 
incidence of a hazardous event, and may therefore 
create a false sense of safety. As a rule of thumb, the 
test rate is always in competition with other frequen -
cies; for this reason, a generic adequate frequency can -
not be stated. Furthermore, tests have the function of 
revealing not only random but also systematic failures. 
On Category 2 single-channel tested systems, the test 
must be passed before a demand is next made upon 
the safety function, i.e. before a potential hazard arises. 
In this scenario, the test rate is therefore in competition 
with the frequency of the demand of the safety function. 
In this case, a factor of 100 is considered sufficient, i.e. 
a test rate that is at least 100 times the mean demand 
rate upon the safety function. By contrast, down to a 
factor of 25, the maximum increase in the probability of 
failure is approximately 10% (refer also to subclause 4 
in [32]). Below this level, the synchronization of demand 
and testing essentially determines whether testing even 
takes effect. Should, in single-channel tested systems, 
the test be executed simultaneously with the demand 
of the safety function and so quickly that the safe state 
is attained before a hazard arises, no conditions are 
im posed upon the frequency of testing. (This applies 
– with reference to the recommendations stated below 
for the test rate in two-channel systems – provided at 
least one demand per year can be assumed.) A special 
example of this is continuous testing (e.g. analogue 
overvoltage/undervoltage monitoring), for which the 
requirements for the test rate are always met when the 
safe state is attained sufficiently swiftly.
In two-channel Category 3 and 4 systems, the test rate 
is in competition with the frequency of incidence of 
a second dangerous failure, since only if the second 
channel fails before a test has detected the failure of 
the first channel does a danger exist of the safety func -
tion not being executed. As per the definition, Category 
4 systems even tolerate the accumulation of undetected 
faults. In practice, a range of recommendations exist for 
the minimum necessary test rate in Categories 3 and 4. 
IEC 61800-5-2 [20] governing the safety of electrical 
power drive systems considers the following minimum 
diagnostic test frequencies acceptable for the case in 
which testing cannot be performed without interruption 
of the machine's working cycle and in which no reaso -
nable technical solution can be implemented: one test 
per year for PL d with Category 3, one test every three \n596 Design of safe control systems
months for PL e with Category 3, and one test per day for 
PL e in Category 4.
In EN ISO 14119 [35] and a “Recommendation for Use” 
by the notified test bodies in the machinery sector [36], 
an automatic or manual test is required at the following 
intervals for electromechanical outputs (relays or con -
tactors): at least once per month for PL e with Category 
3 or 4 and at least once every twelve months for PL d 
with Category 3. The test should preferably be perfor -
med automatically; alternatively, the test interval may 
be monitored automatically. Only in exceptional cases 
should it be assured by organizational measures.
At the test rates stated here, these are minimum 
re quirements that apply when more frequent tests are 
not possible, for example because the test can be per -
formed only when a demand is made upon the safety 
function (for which a signal change is required, as for 
example with electromechanical or fluid power techno -
logy), or because an interruption in the machine's work 
cycle is required, as for example when the machine is 
started at the beginning of the shift. Automatic tests 
that are not subject to these constraints, such as pro -
cessor or memory tests in electronic systems, can often 
be implemented at substantially higher frequency with-
out major overhead. In these cases, testing at least 
once per shift for Category 3 has proved suitable in 
practice; in Category 4, a minimum test rate of once per 
hour was already selected when EN 954-1, the predeces -
sor standard, was in force.
•	A further point is the reliability of the test equipment 
itself. For this, the standard sets out only the basic 
requirements of Category B, applicable to all Catego -
ries, i.e. compliance with the relevant standards in 
order for the anticipated influences to be withstood, 
and the application of basic safety principles. Well-tried 
safety principles should also be applied to the extent 
possible. Where dangerous failures of the test equip -
ment are detected by its cyclical incorporation into the 
process, deviation from these basic requirements is 
permissible. An additional general requirement is that 
the test equipment should not fail prior to the compo -
nents that it monitors. At the same time, it is inefficient 
for much greater investment to be made in the reliability 
of the test equipment than in the safety equipment 
performing the safety function proper. EN ISO 13849-1 
therefore imposes only limited requirements upon the 
reliability of the test equipment. For Categories 3 and 4, 
reliance is upon single-fault tolerance, since including 
failure of the test equipment, a total of three dangerous 
failures must occur before the safety function ceases to 
be performed. The occurrence of such a case unobser -
ved is considered extremely unlikely and not therefore 
critical. For Category 2, a secondary condition exists – 
at least with the simplified procedure for determining of the PL by means of the bar chart – that was set out 
during calculation of the “Category 2 bars”: in this case, 
the dangerous failure rate of the test channel should 
be no more than twice the dangerous failure rate of the 
functional channel that it monitors.
•	The effectiveness of a given test measure, for example 
fault detection by the process, may depend heavily 
upon the application, and can vary anywhere between 
0 and 99%. Particular care must be taken here during 
selection of one of the DC key values. Further explana -
tions can be found in Annex E.
•	Position switches connected in series, where present, 
must be considered during determining of the DCavg 
value for electromechanical contacts. Masking of faults 
may occur in such cases, requiring reduction of the 
DCavg value and the attainable PL. Details can be found 
in Annex E.
•	A situation is possible in which components or blocks 
are monitored by several tests, or in which different 
tests act upon different components, with the result 
that an overall DC must be determined for the compo -
nent or the block. Annex E provides assistance in these 
issues.
•	The DCavg formula (4) provides a means of calculation 
in which blocks with different DC values are grouped 
in such a way that the minimum DCavg requirements for 
the attained Category are met even though individual 
blocks have a DC below 60%, or even no diagnostics at 
all (DC = 0%). In such cases, it must be determined on 
a case-by-case basis whether this form of implementa -
tion is consistent with the requirements of the Category. 
Category 3 requires for example that wherever reasona -
bly possible, a single fault must be detected at or prior 
to the next demand of the safety function. For Category 
2, a “check of the safety function” is a generic require -
ment. Category 4 also requires detection of the discrete 
fault, and only “if this detection is not possible” that 
the safety function also be performed in the event of an 
accumulation of undetected faults.
•	With regard to programmable electronic systems in par -
ticular, a large number of complex faults is conceivable; 
corresponding requirements must therefore also be 
placed upon the complexity of the tests. In this case, 
should a DC of over 60% be required for the (program -
mable or complex) logic, EN ISO 13849-1 calls for at 
least one measure for variable memory, invariableme -
mory and the processing unit – where present – with a 
DC of at least 60% in each case.\n606 Design of safe control systems
Once the DC values of all blocks are known, the DCavg 
value for the system is calculated by means of the 
 approximation formula (4). This formula weights the indi -
vidual DC values with the associated MTTFD values, since 
very reliable parts (with a high MTTFD) are less reliant 
upon effective tests than less reliable parts (the sums in 
numerators and denominators are formed across N blocks 
of the entire system):
(4)+ + ... +
DCavg = DC1             DC2                    DCN 
MTTFD1       MTTFD2                MTTFDN 
+ + ... + 1                  1                           1 
MTTFD1       MTTFD2                MTTFDN 
Once obtained, the DCavg constitutes a value describing 
the quality of the test and monitoring measures averaged 
over the entire SRP/CS. Before this value can be substitu -
ted in the simplified quantification of the PL together with 
the Category (five classes) and the MTTFD of each channel 
(three classes), it must be assigned to one of the four 
classes in Table 6.4.
Table 6.4:  
The four classes of diagnostic coverage in accordance with the 
simplified approach of EN ISO 13849-1
Diagnostic coverage ( DC)
Description Range
None DC < 60%
Low 60% ≤ DC < 90%
Medium 90% ≤ DC < 99%
High 99% ≤ DC
When the DCavg is subsequently used in the simplified 
quantification involving the bar chart (see subclause 
6.2.16), only the respective lower key value of a DCavg class 
(0, 60, 90 or 99) is used. A further simplification thus 
takes effect here, based upon an estimation erring on the 
safe side.
In specific cases, this coarsely simplified system may 
however give rise to paradoxes, if for example an 
 unreliable component with an above-average DC for the 
SRP/CS is replaced by a more reliable component (for a 
more detailed explanation, refer to the end of Annex G).
6.2.15  Measures against common cause  
failure (CCF)
The final parameter relevant to the simplified quantifi-
cation of the probability of failure concerns common 
cause failures (CCF). Such failures are related dangerous 
failures, for example in both channels of a redundant 
SRP/CS, that are attributable to a common cause. 
Ex amples include unfavourable environmental conditions or overloads that were not adequately addressed during 
design of the control system. Should the channels not 
be adequately separated, dangerous secondary faults 
may occur that render the intended single-fault tolerance 
ineffective. The quantitative relevance of these effects 
in a specific system is difficult to estimate (refer also to 
Annex F). In Annex D of IEC 61508-6 [37], the “beta-factor” 
model is used for this purpose. In this model, the rate of 
common cause failure is placed, as β · λD, in relation to 
the dangerous failure rate of a channel λD. Without a pre -
cise FMEA, β can at best only be estimated for real-case  
SRP/CS, however. For this purpose, EN ISO 13849-1 con -
tains a checklist of eight important counter-measures, for 
which between 5 and 25 points are awarded:
•	Physical separation between the signal paths of diffe -
rent channels (15 points)
•	Diversity in the technology, the design or the physical 
principles of the channels (20 points)
•	Protection against possible overloading (15 points)
•	 Use of well-tried components (5 points)
•	Failure mode and effects analysis during development, 
for the identification of potential common cause fail-
ures (5 points)
•	Training of designers/maintainers in CCF and its avoi -
dance (5 points)
•	Protection against common cause failures triggered by 
contamination (mechanical and fluid power systems) 
and electromagnetic interference (electrical systems) 
(25 points)
•	Protection against common cause failures triggered by 
unfavourable environmental conditions (10 points)
The points stated for a given counter-measure are to be 
awarded either in full, or not at all; no points are awarded 
for a “partial” implementation of the counter-measures. 
Different packages of measures may however be effective 
against CCF at subsystem level. Should all eight counter-
measures be satisfied, a maximum total of 100 points is 
awarded. However, EN ISO 13849-1 requires only a mini -
mum total of 65 points and even then, only for SRP/CS in 
Categories 2, 3 and 4. In Category 2 systems, the objective 
is the avoidance of dangerous common cause failures 
in test and functional channels that could give rise to an 
undetected occurrence of a dangerous fault. During crea -
tion of the bar chart for simplified quantification, the 65 
points were equated to a beta factor of 2%. The coarse 
approximation with respect to the five Categories and the 
three MTTFD and four DCavg classes was carried further and 
reduced to a simple yes/no decision. Whereas the bene -\n616 Design of safe control systems
fits of a redundant structure are wiped out almost com-
pletely even at a beta factor of 10% or higher, a beta factor 
of no more than 2% reduces the relevance of common 
cause failures to a justifiable level.
6.2.16 Simplified determining of the PL by 
means of the bar chart
Even when the four essential quantitative parameters 
for calculation of the probability of failure have been 
re solved, determining the PL attained for the SRP/CS from 
them is still a difficult task. Although in principle, any 
suitable method is permitted, EN ISO 13849-1 proposes a 
simple graphical method that is based upon more com -
plex calculations and estimations erring on the safe side: 
the bar-chart method (see Figure 6.10).
This diagram was generated by Markov  modelling based 
upon the designated architectures for the Categories; further details can be found in Annex G. When the bar 
chart is used, the relevant bar is first determined on the 
horizontal axis from the attained Category in combination 
with the attained DCavg class. Adequate measures against 
CCF must be provided for Categories 2, 3 and 4 in this 
case. The level of the MTTFD attained by the SRP/CS on 
the selected bar determines the PL, which can be read 
off on the vertical axis. This method permits rapid quali -
tative estimation of the attained PL even in the absence 
of precise quantitative data. Should more precise values 
be required, for example not only the PL, but also a value 
for the average probability of a dangerous failure per hour 
PFHD, the tables in Annex K of the standard provide assis -
tance. Similar assistance is also provided by the IFA's 
SISTEMA software (see Annex H), which analyses the bar 
chart quantitatively, and by the IFA's user-friendly PLC disc 
[16].

Bar chart for simpli-
fied determining 
of the PL from the 
Category (including 
measures against 
CCF), the DCavg and 
the MTTFD\n626 Design of safe control systems
During creation of the bar chart, consideration was not 
only given to designated architectures; certain conditions 
were also laid down that must be observed when the 
chart is applied:
•	A mission time of 20 years is assumed for the  
SRP/CS, within which the component reliabilities can 
be described or approximated by constant failure rates. 
The actual mission time may fall below the assumed 
20 years owing to the use of components subject to 
severe wear (refer to the T10D value in Annex D) or for 
other reasons. Application of the bar chart is justified 
in such cases by preventive replacement of the affected 
components or SRP/CS. This information must be made 
available to the user in a suitable form, for example  
in the information for use and by marking on the  
SRP/CS. Exceeding of the mission time of 20 years 
from the outset or its extension retrospectively beyond 
20 years result in deviations from the bar chart. Annex G 
shows how this can be addressed.
•	In the bars for Category 2, it has been assumed that 
the test rate is adequately high (refer also to sub -
clause 6.2.14 and Annex E) and also that the test chan -
nel is at least half as reliable as the functional channel.
Owing to capping of the MTTFD that can be allowed for 
each channel to 100 years (2,500 years in the case of 
Category 4), a high PL can be attained only with certain 
Categories. Although this is related to the simplified 
approach of the designated architectures and the bar 
chart, the associated limitations also apply when the 
average probability of a dangerous failure per hour is cal -
culated by means of other, unrelated methods. As already 
mentioned, the architecture imposes the following limita -
tions upon certain Categories. These limitations are inten -
ded to prevent the component reliability from being over -
stated in comparison with the other influencing variables:
•	In Category B, a maximum PL of b can be attained. 
•	In Category 1, a maximum PL of c can be attained. 
•	 In Category 2, a maximum PL of d can be attained. 
•	 In Categories 3 or 4, even a PL of e can be attained.
Besides the quantitative aspect of the probability of 
failure, qualitative aspects must also be considered for 
attainment of a given PL. Such aspects include systematic 
failures (see subclause 6.1.2), and software faults, which 
are discussed in greater detail in subclause 6.3.6.2.17 Determining the PL for the output part 
of the SRP/CS (power control elements) 
in accordance with subclause 4.5.5 of 
the standard
In response to calls voiced by industry, an alternative, 
simplified method for determining the PFHD and quanti -
fiable aspects of the PL was added in the third edition of 
the standard. This method, described in subclause 4.5.5 
of the standard, can be applied only in certain cases, 
namely:
•	for the output part of the SRP/CS (power control ele -
ments) and
•	when no application-specific reliability data ( MTTFD, fai-
lure rate λD, B10D or similar) are available for mechanical, 
hydraulic or pneumatic components (or components 
employing mixed technology, such as a pneumatically 
driven mechanical brake).
This simplified determining of the PFHD is based primarily 
upon the implemented Category including DCavg and CCF. 
Calculation of the (channel ) MTTFD is not required; in 
return, well-tried components (in Categories 1, 2, 3 and 4) 
or proven-in-use components (in Categories 2, 3 and 4) 
must be used throughout. “Proven-in-use” is a new com -
ponent property used within the standard and should not 
be confused with the property of well-tried. The property 
of proven-in-use is demonstrated based upon an analysis 
of experience gained in the field with a specific configura -
tion of a component in a specific application. The analysis 
must show that the probability of dangerous systematic 
faults is sufficiently low for each safety function using the 
component to reach its required Performance Level PLr 
(new definition in 3.1.39 of the standard). Such a demon-
stration has not been common in machine construction 
before now. It is also unclear why the requirement refers 
only to systematic faults, and fails to consider the random 
component faults.
Table 6.5 shows the estimated PFHD value and the PL 
 attainable with it, based upon Table 7 in the new sub -
clause 4.5.5 of the standard, as a function of the imple -
mented Category and subject to the additional conditions 
placed upon the method.
The method is subject to the following additional condi -
tions:
•	Since the estimated PFHD values are based upon the 
simplified method for estimation of a PL (bar chart),  
the same conditions apply as for the designated 
architectures. A mission time of 20 years and constant 
failure rates within the mission time are assumed. In \n636 Design of safe control systems

Further conditions apply, see Section 6.2.17
Category 2, the tests must be performed adequately 
frequently. No provision is made here for a test rate that 
is only 25 times the demand rate.
•	In Category 1: use of well-tried components and well-
tried safety principles (as in the past and as established 
in the Category 1 definition).
•	In Category 2: the MTTFD of the test channel is at least 
ten years.
•	In Categories 2, 3 and 4: use of well-tried or proven-in-
use components and use of well-tried safety principles. 
In Category 2, there is no advantage in extending this 
requirement to the test channel, since the same result 
(PFHD and PL) can be attained with a Category 1 single-
channel system.
•	In Categories 2 and 3: adequate measures against CCF, 
and DC of each component at least “low”. 
•	In Category 4: adequate measures against CCF, and DC 
“high” for each component.
The DC requirement in the last two of these points applies 
to each component in the subsystem, and therefore 
exceeds their respective generic requirements for the 
Category, which relate to DCavg. Since however this con -
cerns the output part of the SRP/CS with mechanical, 
hydraulic or pneumatic components, only one component 
per channel will be involved in most cases. Consequently, 
the requirement for the DC of each component does not 
in practice constitute tightening of the requirements com-
pared to the DCavg of the subsystem.
The following additional information is provided:
•	Category 1: the machine manufacturer must determine 
the T10D values of safety-related components based upon data for their proven-in-use property, unless fail-
ure of these components becomes apparent through 
the technical process.
•	Categories 2, 3 and 4: since recourse cannot be made to 
formula E.1 of the standard (formula (4) of the present 
report) for calculation of the DCavg owing to the unavai -
lability of MTTFD values, the DCavg is formed in this case 
simply as the arithmetic mean of the individual DCs of 
all components in the functional channels of the output 
part.
6.2.18 Bus systems as “interconnecting means”
The discrete blocks of a designated architecture – input 
unit, logic and output unit – must be connected together 
not only logically, but also physically. For this purpose, 
the standard defines “interconnecting means”, which 
are regarded as part of the SRP/CS. The term “intercon -
necting means” may initially appear strange in the field 
of electrical or fluid power technology. However, it serves 
as a generic term for electrical and fluid power lines, 
and even for such components as mechanical plungers. 
All requirements of the standard therefore also apply to 
these forms of “interconnecting means”. In the context of 
fault consideration, a conductor short circuit for example 
is an assumed fault. What is the situation however when 
bus systems are used to transmit safety-related informa -
tion? Detailed consideration of such a complex subject is 
of course outside the scope of the standard, particularly 
since the subject is already covered by DGUV test prin -
ciples (GS-ET-26, [38]) and a standard (IEC 61784-3 [39]). 
Bus systems that satisfy the requirements set out in these 
publications can also be readily employed in the context 
of EN ISO 13849-1. Numerous bus systems suitable for 
safety-related applications are already available on the 
market.\n646 Design of safe control systems
The publications referred to above employ a special fault 
model in which consideration is given to the use of a 
black-box channel for the transmission of safety-related 
data: in other words, no particular requirements for fault 
detection, for example, are placed upon this transmis -
sion channel itself. The model assumes the repetition, 
loss, insertion, incorrect sequence, corruption and delay 
of safety-related messages and the coupling of safety-
related and non-safety-related messages as possible 
faults. Further possible aspects include faults that syste -
matically corrupt messages, for example by completely 
inverting them. Measures in “safety layers” that are then 
implemented in safety-related parts of control systems 
enable transmission faults to be excluded with sufficient 
probability. Suitable measures include, for example, 
the sequence number, timestamp, time expectations, 
connection authentication, feedback message and data 
integrity assurance. Data integrity assurance in particular 
frequently entails complex calculations. The purpose of 
these calculations is to determine the residual error pro -
bability R, and from it the residual error rate Λ (derived 
from the lower-case λ for the failure rate for components). 
Exactly this value can then be calculated as the average 
probability of a dangerous failure per hour required for a 
PL as a proportion for the transmission of safety-relevant 
messages. Both of the above publications limit the resi -
dual error rate to 1% of the maximum permissible value 
for the probability of a dangerous failure per hour. Values 
stated by manufacturers are in fact frequently related to 
an SIL (see Chapter 3); in practice, however, these values 
are compatible for use under a required PL (see also 
Figure 3.2). The 1% rule results in the contribution to the 
probability of a dangerous failure per hour being virtually 
negligible, i.e. it enables it to be added to the values 
determined for the SRP/CS. Comprehensive information 
on bus systems for the transmission of safety-related 
information can be found for example in [40].
Where a bus system (i.e. its components), which is gene -
rally tested by an independent body, is employed for the 
implementation of safety functions, planning of its use 
and proper implementation with regard to fault avoidance 
are of great importance. A large number of parameters 
must be set correctly; this process is supported to a grea -
ter or lesser degree by relevant tools.
Should none of the known, already assessed profiles 
for functional safety be used, the assumed transmission 
errors stated above must be considered, suitable (coun -
ter) measures implemented, and the residual error rate 
Λ in consideration of the typical bit error rate of 0.01 con -
sidered during calculation of the total failure probability 
PFHD. Test principles GS-ET-26 [38] provide information on 
calculation of the residual error rate Λ.6.3  Development of safety-related software
Comments such as the following are frequently heard: 
“Of course, a software programmer with years of experi -
ence no longer makes mistakes. ” This hubris is in fact the 
 greatest mistake of all. Software is generally complicated, 
which is why the number of failures caused by software 
faults is on the rise, in contrast to the situation for hard -
ware. How often are PC users surprised when a computer 
peripheral ceases to work, and how often does the prob -
lem turn out to have been caused by a part of the software 
that was not compatible with another piece of software, 
such as a driver? By contrast, hardware tend to be rare. 
According to [41], normal software, i.e. simple software 
for simple functions, contains approximately 25 errors per 
1,000 lines of code. Also according to [41], well written 
software contains around two to three errors per 1,000 
lines of code, and the software employed in the Space 
Shuttle has (according to NASA) fewer than one error per 
10,000 lines. What does this mean in practice? A mobile 
telephone has up to 200,000 lines of code and therefore 
up to 600 software errors. A PC operating system has 
27 million lines of code and therefore up to 50,000 errors; 
the Space Shuttle up to 300 errors; and the software for 
the Space Defense Initiative (SDI) up to 10,000 errors. 
These programming errors lie dormant in the products 
until, under certain conditions and in certain situations, 
they impact upon the products' function. Like no other 
technology, software and therefore also its programmers 
assume a greater responsibility than ever before.
One of the essential changes in EN ISO 13849-1 compared 
to its predecessor, EN 954-1, was the formulation for the 
first time of requirements concerning software and its 
development. For the sake of emphasis at this point: the 
requirements in subclause 4.6 of the standard enable 
safety-related software to be developed for all SRP/CS 
in the machinery sector and for all required Performance 
Levels from a to e. This subclause is intended in the first 
instance for application programmers tasked with deve -
loping the safety functions for a machine, for example 
in an application-oriented language on a programmable 
logic controller (PLC). By contrast, these requirements in 
EN ISO 13849-1 are not particularly new to developers of 
SRESW (safety-related embedded software), i.e. firmware 
or software tools for electronic safety components. Such 
“embedded software” developments for the components, 
which are generally certified, are often subject to the very 
complex requirements of the IEC 61508-3 basic safety 
standard [42] (and its further seven parts), which is bin -
ding for IEC standards governing functional safety.
IFA Report 2/2016 on safety-related application software 
for machinery [43] has been published, addressing the 
programming of SRASW (safety-related application soft -
ware). This report describes the IFA's matrix method for 
the specification, verification, validation and documen -\n656 Design of safe control systems
tation of SRASW. The matrix method can also be used 
with the IFA's SOFTEMA tool [44]. In addition, the report 
provides detailed further information on the programming 
of SRASW. The descriptions below are therefore limited 
to a brief presentation of the normative requirements of 
EN ISO 13849-1 concerning safety-related software.
The basic principles of this subclause can be applied to 
both software types. Individual requirements tend to be 
formulated in detail more for application programming of 
SRASW. Conversely, the example described in subclause 
6.5 of a control system for a paper-cutting guillotine 
shows the development of SRESW.
The requirements governing software development are 
geared to the software type (SRASW or SRESW) and the 
language type. As in other current standards containing 
requirements for software, a distinction is drawn be tween 
the language types FVL (full variability language) and 
LVL (limited variability language). SRASW is generally 
programmed in LVL, for example in a graphical language 
as defined in IEC 61131-3. The requirements contained in 
subclause 4.6.3 of EN ISO 13849-1 apply in this case.
As soon as SRASW is programmed in FVL (for example, 
a PLC in the high-level language “C”), however, the re -
quirements for SRESW contained in subclause 4.6.2 of the 
standard must be met. If the SRASW is required to satisfy 
a Performance Level of e in this case, EN ISO 13849-1 
refers at the end of subclause 4.6.2, once only, but with 
exceptions, to the requirements of IEC 61508-3:1998.6.3.1 Error-free software …
… unfortunately does not exist in the real world. In con-
trast to hardware faults, which occur as a result of random 
component failure, the causes of software faults are 
systematic. It is therefore all the more important that all 
reasonable steps be taken to avoid errors during the deve -
lopment of safety-related software, the purpose of which 
is after all that of minimizing risks. What is considered 
reasonable is determined on the one hand by the required 
Performance Level PLr. At the same time, safety-critical 
faults tend to creep into particular phases of software 
development, where, devastatingly, they remain undetec -
ted until they cause a failure in operation. These phases 
are known to be those of specification, design and modi -
fication. The requirements of EN ISO 13849-1 – and the 
explanations provided in this subclause – are therefore 
aimed in particular at fault avoidance in these phases. 
Sadly, less attention is often paid in practice to these pha -
ses of application programming.
In order for the safety-related software produced to be of 
high quality, it is clear that suitable up-to-date and well-
tried “software engineering” development models should 
be followed. For safety-related systems, reference is gene -
rally made in this context to the “V model” [45]. Since the 
V model familiar from the reference is generally used for 
very complex software, EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 4.6.1 
requires only a more simplified form of it (Figure 6.11).

This form is considered to be appropriate for the practical 
conditions and the objectives for safety-related SRP/CS in 
the machinery sector and specifically for the development 
of SRASW. The actual objective here is the creation of rea -
dable, understandable, testable and maintainable soft -
ware. Programmers who do not normally develop safety-
related software are likely to consider these requirements 
tedious. However, they provide them with the certainty of 
having developed the software to an adequate standard.
In addition to the phases, Figure 6.11 also shows impor -
tant terminology that must first be defined (in a software 
context).
Result
Refers to the product of a phase, for example the specifi -
cation, the software design, the code, and in the case of 
the final result, the tested, validated software. It may how -
ever also refer for example to the result of a specification 
phase in the form of a test plan that is not required until a 
much later phase, at which it can be used for systematic 
validation of the software. The result(s) of the preceding 
phases serve as inputs for the subsequent phases. This is 
indicated by the arrow.
Verification
Describes the quality assurance activity by which the 
result of a phase is checked against the specification of 
the preceding phase. During or at the end of the coding 
phase, for example, verification is performed of whe -
ther the code actually implements the specified module 
design, and whether the programming guidelines have 
been observed in the process.
Validation
In this context, software validation is a concluding, spe -
cial form of verification of the entire software. A check is 
performed of whether the requirements of the software 
specification concerning the functionality of the software 
have been implemented.
Selected phases of the simplified V model, and thus at 
the same time the “roadmap” for software development, 
are described below. The downward-pointing part of the 
“V” describes the design activities of development, the 
upward-pointing part the review activities.
6.3.2 Overall safety interface: software  
specification
This document describes, based upon the higher-level 
specification of the safety functions of the SRP/CS, the 
sub-functions of the specification that are to be imple -mented by the software. In addition, the following are 
presented:
•	Functions that detect and control hardware faults
•	Performance characteristics, such as the maximum 
 response time
•	Fault-mode responses
•	Interfaces provided to other systems, etc. 
Besides these functional requirements, the PL to be 
 attained by the safety functions, the PLr, must be stated, 
in order to permit selection of the necessary measures for 
fault avoidance (see further below).
This specification (or “safety-related software require -
ments specification”) must be verified, for example by a 
review performed by a person not involved in its creation. 
The reviewer must confirm firstly that the requirements 
specification complies with the higher-level specification, 
and secondly that it satisfies the formal requirements 
governing how a software specification is to be written. 
The specification should be structured and generated in 
detail in such a way that it can also serve as a checklist for 
later validation.
The overall safety of a machine or machinery installation 
is assured by all safety-related parts of the control system 
and their functions (components of all technologies, elec -
tronics, software). A description is therefore required at 
this point, in the form of a specification, of the safety for 
the machine/machinery installation. The document need 
not run into the hundreds of pages; it is acceptable for it 
to be limited to the essential points in a comprehensible 
form. The specifications for the machine or machinery 
in stallation as a whole will be followed by a subset of 
tasks for programmers. The software specification thus 
forms a part of the overall concept, and can therefore be 
regarded as a “contract” with a “subcontract” for the pro -
gramming function.
The software specification begins with provisions con -
cerning design and coding of the software. The other 
elements involved in assuring safety must be able to rely 
upon implementation of the functions in the software. The 
specification is thus also the point of reference for accep -
tance of the software: validation of the software functions 
must demonstrate whether the “contractual obligations” 
have been met. In the area of SRASW, this must be taken 
literally, since the engineering and programming of a con -
trol system are often assigned by the parties responsible 
for safety as a whole to other companies or corporate 
divisions. In this case, the specification also serves as a 
contractually binding interface to external or internal ser -
vice providers.\n676 Design of safe control systems
6.3.3 System and module design for the 
“safety-related technical specification”
The software architecture is generally already defined by 
the operating system or the development tool. The design 
further defines the structure and modules to be employed 
for implementation of the specified safety sub-functions. 
What existing library functions are to be employed must 
be determined, as must whether new functions may have 
to be developed specifically for the project. In this sub -
clause, the term software function/module also refers in 
all cases to a function block.
The software design document should describe the struc -
ture and process of the software, supported by diagrams, 
in a way that makes these aspects comprehensible to 
external parties. The more the program is based upon re-
used software functions that have already been validated 
and are already documented elsewhere, the more concise 
the software design document can be. The module design 
also specifies the new software functions that are to be 
produced specifically for the project, their interfaces, and 
test cases for their module test. For less complex SRP/CS, 
the system and module design can be summarized in a 
“safety-related software technical specification”.
6.3.4 Finally: programming
Coding work proper then begins. In the interests of fault 
avoidance, the following three aspects must be observed:
•	Code must be readable and clear, in order to facilitate 
testing and error-free modification at a later stage. Bin -
ding programming guidelines facilitate, among other 
things, better commenting of the program and the 
assignment of self-explanatory names to variables and 
modules.
•	Defensive programming, i.e. the assumption that inter -
nal or external errors may always be present, and detec -
tion of them. If the characteristic of input signals over 
time is known, for example, this anticipatory approach 
can be used to detect errors in the peripheral circuitry. 
If a finite-state machine is being programmed, the state 
variable is monitored for a valid value range, etc.
•	The code must be analysed statically, i.e. without exe -
cution: for low PLs, a code review is sufficient; for PLs 
d and e, the data and control flow should also be exa -
mined, ideally with the use of tools. Typical questions 
are: is the code consistent with the preceding software 
design? Do any points exist at which signals with a 
lower PL (for example from a standard PLC) override a 
signal with a higher PL? Where and by what modules are 
variables initialized, written to, and then assigned to 
the safety output? What software functions are executed 
conditionally?6.3.5 Module test, integration test and 
 validation
In the module test, the new software functions developed 
specifically for the project are tested and simulated in 
order to check whether they are coded as specified in the 
module design. At the integration test at the latest, for 
example during the typical commissioning of a machine's 
PLC, the complete software is tested for proper operation 
on the hardware (integration) and compliance with the 
system design (verification). Both are still verification 
measures, i.e. they involve looking “into” the software. 
Whether the safety-related sub-functions of the software 
perform as specified is determined by software validation, 
which has already been described. For the higher PLs d 
and e, an extended functional test is also required.
Individual software functions that have been certified or 
validated by quality assurance measures do not need to 
be tested again. As soon as a number of these functions 
are combined for a specific project, however, the resulting 
new form of safety sub-function must be validated. Even 
on certified modules, dangerous systematic failures may 
be caused by errors in parameterization and logic.
6.3.6 Structure of the normative requirements
Once the design process has been outlined, normative 
requirements are described for the software itself, for the 
development tools used, and for the development acti -
vities. These requirements also contribute towards fault 
avoidance. The effort involved should be commensurate 
with the required risk reduction, in the same way as for 
the hardware of the programmable SRP/CS. The require-
ments and their effectiveness are therefore increased 
intelligently in line with rising PLr. 
Figure 6.12 shows that a suitable package of basic meas-
ures is first set out for all PLs for both SRASW and SRESW. 
These basic measures can be regarded as software-speci -
fic basic safety principles. They are sufficient for the deve -
lopment of software for PL a or b. For software employed 
in SRP/CS for PL c to e, the basic measures are supple -
mented by additional measures for fault avoidance. The 
latter are required for PL c with lower effectiveness, for 
PL d with medium effectiveness and for PL e with higher 
effectiveness. Irrespective of whether the software now 
acts in only one or in both channels of a desired Category, 
the PLr of the implemented safety function(s) is always the 
yardstick for the requirements.
The aspect of “higher effectiveness” refers to the rising 
level of fault avoidance. This may be illustrated by the 
important task of production of the specification. For PL c, 
for example, it may be sufficient for programmers to write 
the specification themselves and for it to be reviewed by 
others (internal review). Should the same software \n686 Design of safe control systems

be employed for PL e, however, a higher level of fault 
avoidance must be attained. It may then be necessary 
for the specification to be written by the software project 
manager, for example, rather than the programmers. In 
addition, the review of this specification could be perfor -
med jointly with a more independent person, such as the 
person responsible for hardware engineering. More eyes 
(generally) find more errors. A comprehensive discussion 
of the individual requirements and of their greater or 
lesser effectiveness is unfortunately beyond the scope of 
the present report. Discussion will therefore be limited to 
certain particular cases:
•	It is not uncommon for cohesive software of SRP/CS to 
implement several safety functions (SFx) of differing PLr 
(e.g. SF1 and SF2 with PLr c, SF3 with PLr e). In practice 
however, it is unlikely to be possible to differentiate 
between the safety functions of differing PLr in the 
development cycle, the tools, or the effectiveness of the 
activities (e.g. during modifications). In this case, the 
requirements for fault avoidance are therefore geared 
towards the highest PLr (in the example given: e).
•	Redundant SRP/CS of which only one channel is pro -
grammable: although the programmable electronics 
constitute only a single channel, the overall structure 
satisfies Category 3 or 4. Safety functions with a hig -
her PLr, such as d or e, are frequently implemented by 
means of these structures. If programmable electronics 
are employed in one channel of the part of the control 
system in diverse redundancy with a technology other 
than programmable electronics (e.g. fluid power tech -
nology) in the other channel, the IFA's recommendation 
is that the normative requirements can be reduced by 
one PL level, e.g. for PLr c instead of PLr d, owing to the 
lower probability of a dangerous failure caused by sys -tematic faults in this SRASW. Irrespective of this, the 
normative requirements for the SRESW must also be 
observed (subclause 6.3.10). 
•	Use of standard PLCs: the circuit examples in this report 
(see Chapter 8, Page 99 ff.) demonstrate that standard 
PLCs can in principle also be used to engineer safety-
related control systems. Only for PL e is it likely to be 
very difficult to attain the required “high” level of dia -
gnostic coverage DC of at least 99% for the hardware 
of a PLC – at least if this diagnostic coverage is to be 
implemented by the SRASW. For PL a to d, the software 
requirements for the standard PLC are described in 
subclause 6.3.10. The requirements for the avoidance 
of errors in SRASW (subclauses 4.6.1 and 4.6.3 of the 
standard) in accordance with the PLr must also be met 
during application programming. The topic of systema -
tic capability requires particular attention.
•	A bonus during the development of diverse SRESW 
is that on two-channel SRP/CS for one or more safety 
functions with a PLr of e, the SRESW of the two channels 
can be implemented diversely. Should the degree of 
this diversity be so great that the code, the design, and 
even the specification have been created differently, 
this software can also be developed in accordance with 
the requirements set out in EN ISO 13849-1 for PL d. It is 
then irrelevant whether the SRP/CS have two different 
or identical hardware channels.
6.3.7 Suitable software tools
No software without tools: this particularly holds true for 
safety-related software. The selection and quality of these 
tools are therefore decisive factors for the avoidance \n696 Design of safe control systems
of errors and thus for the quality of the safety function. 
EN ISO 13849-1 emphasizes four elements:
•	Development tools:  
Development requires tools that are suitable and well-
tried for the intended use. Certified tools for safety com -
ponents are generally employed for SRASW. Features 
such as the avoidance and detection of semantic errors, 
the observance of language subsets or the monitoring 
of programming guidelines relieve programmers of 
tasks and enhance the quality of the software.
•	Libraries of software functions:  
The design of the system should consider existing 
or supplied libraries and, where practicable, employ 
validated functions. The following principle applies: 
the more the program is based upon functions that are 
already validated or indeed certified, the fewer project-
specific software components remain that must be 
validated internally or by an external organization prior 
to commissioning. For typical recurring functions, sys -
tem integrators are well advised to invest the necessary 
effort in developing suitable modules themselves to 
EN ISO 13849-1 such that they can also be re-used and 
tested, including by independent persons, routinely 
and without error. Discrete library functions also require 
specification, design, test plan, validation, etc.
•	Suitable programming languages:  
For SRASW, application-oriented languages are recom -
mended, for example in accordance with IEC 61131-3 
[46]. Even these languages are more comprehensive 
than necessary, and contain constructs that in some 
cases are error-prone. Programmers should therefore 
limit the use of the syntax. Corresponding language 
subsets are generally specified by the tool.
•	Programming guidelines:  
Suitable programming guidelines must be observed for 
coding of the software functions [47]. The guidelines 
should be the existing, accepted rules of a recognized 
organization. Alternatively, a company may draw up sui -
table programming guidelines of its own, provided they 
have a sound practical or theoretical basis. Program -
ming guidelines govern the use of critical language con -
structs, the scope and interface of software functions, 
the formatting and commenting of the code, symbolic 
names of functions and variables, etc. 
These tools and guidelines should be specified in the 
design document.
6.3.8 Unloved, but important: documentation 
and configuration management
Before the manufacturer issues the EC declaration of 
conformity for a machine, he must draw up its technical documentation. Where safety-related software is con-
cerned, this refers in the first instance to specification 
of the implemented safety functions (requirements 
specification), the design document (technical specifica -
tion), and the well-commented program. In addition, the 
certified or self-validated library functions used must be 
listed together with their identification (version number, 
author, date, etc.). Application of the manufacturer's own 
programming guidelines and language subsets must also 
be documented. Should these already be contained in 
the tool, an appropriate reference to these properties is 
sufficient. Finally, the test activities must be documented. 
The integration test and validation of the safety functions 
are often performed at the same time. These tests must 
obviously be planned and must be documented together 
with the test results.
What is meant by configuration management? For safety-
related software in particular, it is obvious and therefore 
a requirement that its development be transparent to all 
parties involved and for subsequent inspections:
•	Who performed specification, programming, commis-
sioning, verification and validation, and when?
•	What was used for development, e.g. tools and their 
settings, re-used functions and their identification, pro -
gramming guidelines?
•	 What program versions are loaded on which SRP/CS?
This and other necessary information, including all rele -
vant development documents, must be recorded and 
suitably archived for later use, for example for the event of 
modification after several years in operation.
6.3.9 Software is in a constant state of 
change: modification
Experience has shown that even after having initially been 
tested, SRASW will still be the subject of fervent extension 
and adaptation work during commissioning of an instal -
lation or machine. This procedure is termed “modifica -
tion”. These changes are often so extensive that not only 
the code, but even the original specification is no longer 
appropriate and should in fact be revised. Changes to 
safety functions at one end of the installation or machine 
may also have an impact on the safety functions at the 
other end that have not been modified that at this stage. 
Equally, the modifications may reveal gaps in the safety 
concept. This possibility should be examined, and the 
necessary phases of the V model repeated if appropriate.
Practical experience also shows however that even after 
it has been installed, a machine or installation may still 
require an additional emergency stop facility or guard 
door, for example. The machining process is also fre -\n706 Design of safe control systems
quently improved: once again, the safety concept must 
be adapted in this case. The existing software must be 
“modified”. Note: this may be the case on SRP/CS that 
have already been operated for a longer period of time 
and for the most part without failures caused by software 
faults – which could equally mean that a present but 
“hidden” fault has simply not yet taken effect. Following 
a modification, however, this situation may change, for 
example if the software was not adequately structured 
and individual modules/functions are not therefore 
en tirely without reciprocal influence.
In the situations described, “Murphy's Law” often takes 
effect: the program was written many years previously, but 
the original programmers now have more pressing tasks 
or have already left the company. In this case, it is in the 
interests of both the safety and economy of the machine 
or installation for the software to possess the properties 
stated above: legibility, structure, intelligibility, and also 
the facility for straightforward, non-error-prone modifica -
tion – irrespective of whatever programming personnel 
happen to be available.
In principle, a modification means that the design pro -
cess must be restarted, i.e. in the V model, at the point at 
which a change was made (Figure 6.11), for example:
•	When the code has been changed, the module and inte -
gration test must be repeated, as must validation.
•	If changes were also required to the specification, it 
too must be verified again, for example by review by a 
colleague, in order to ensure that no faults have crept in 
at a different point in the specification. Accordingly, all 
development and verification measures and also valida -
tion of the affected safety functions must be repeated.
In view of the effort described, it is understandable that 
the influence of a modification upon the safety functions 
must be studied and documented systematically. Since 
modifications may have a not inconsiderable effect upon 
proper performance of the safety function, a suitable 
procedure must be set out from the outset. If appropriate, 
this should include appointment of the persons respon -
sible.
6.3.10 Requirements for the software of 
 standard components in SRP/CS
Safety-related controls are often implemented by means 
of standard components for industrial applications. Since 
the standard formulates requirements for the implemen -
tation of SRESW and SRASW, these must also be satisfied 
with regard to electronically programmable standard com -
ponents. Restrictions exist however that do not apply to 
tested safety components. Requirements for SRESW
The use of externally sourced industrial standard compo -
nents not developed specifically for use in safety func -
tions and containing embedded software was not previ -
ously addressed in EN ISO 13849-1. Numerous examples 
of SRP/CS exist in practice however that make use of 
standard components such as PLCs, frequency inverters 
or sensors and that implement safety for example by 
diverse redundancy with fault detection at system level. 
An example employing a standard PLC and a standard fre -
quency inverter is shown in Annex I of the standard. Since 
observance of the SRESW requirements is not generally 
confirmed by the manufacturer for such standard com -
ponents and cannot be performed subsequently by the 
integrator, satisfaction of the SRESW requirements was 
not demonstrated in the past.
EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 4.6.2 now dispenses with the 
need for satisfaction of the SRESW requirements to be 
demonstrated for such standard components, provided 
the following conditions are met:
•	The SRP/CS is limited to PL a or PL b and uses Catego -
ries B, 2 or 3.
•	The SRP/CS is limited to PL c or PL d and its use of mul -
tiple components for two channels in Categories 2 or 
3 is permissible. The components in these two chan -
nels employ diverse technologies. The requirement for 
diverse technologies in the two channels leads to the 
probability of a dangerous failure of the SRP/CS caused 
by an error in the SRESW being strongly reduced.
Besides the SRESW requirements, the standard sets out 
further requirements, more concerning the hardware, 
that must be met when standard components are used 
for SRP/CS. These include the avoidance and control of 
systematic faults, and suitability for the anticipated envi -
ronmental conditions such as climate, vibration and elec -
tromagnetic compatibility (EMC). These additional requi -
rements continue to apply irrespective of SRESW. They 
also include the requirement for basic safety principles to 
be applied from Category B upwards and well-tried safety 
principles from Category 1 upwards. In addition, the basic 
requirements of Category B must be met for all Catego -
ries, namely: the SRP/CS must be designed, constructed, 
selected, assembled and combined at least in compliance 
with the relevant standards, for example IEC 61131-2 for 
PLCs and IEC 61800-1/2 for frequency inverters. 
Development with quality assurance in accordance with 
ISO 900x is not made an explicit requirement by the stan -
dard; it can however be regarded as a basic safety prin -
ciple with regard to the use of standard components.\n716 Design of safe control systems
Table 6.6 shows the possible combinations of PL and 
Category with standard components, and whether and if 
so how the requirements upon SRESW are to be met.
It remains to be clarified what is meant by “technological 
diversity”. This means that owing to the diversity bet -ween two channels (the difference in the technologies 
em ployed), the probability of a dangerous failure of the 
SRP/CS being caused by an error in the SRESW is strongly 
reduced. Systematic failures and common cause failures 
are relevant in this context.

including to industrial standard compo -
nents. A safety analysis by the compo -
nent manufacturer is required.
5 e 3, 4 Section 4.6.2 of the standard states that PL e is 
not possible for standard components. 
The requirement for “technological diversity” can nor -
mally be regarded as satisfied in the following examples:
•	One channel (functional channel or test channel) 
employs components containing embedded software. 
The second channel employs solely components with-
out embedded software, i.e. mechanical, electronic, 
electromechanical, pneumatic or hydraulic compo -
nents.
•	The two channels employ diverse embedded software, 
such as different operating systems running on identi -
cal or different hardware.  
Note : when identical hardware is used, particular atten -
tion must be paid to the systematic capability of the 
components for the required Performance Level.
•	The two channels employ different hardware (e.g. micro -
processors with different processor cores), since it is 
assumed that the associated embedded software was 
programmed in different development environments.
The requirement for “technological diversity” can nor -
mally be regarded as not being satisfied in the following 
examples:•	The two channels employ components of the same kind 
from different manufacturers, without further informa -
tion on the diversity of the embedded software. In this 
scenario, it cannot normally be ruled out that the two 
manufacturers use the same embedded software com -
ponents, and possibly even identical hardware (brand 
labelling).
•	The two channels employ components of different kinds 
from the same manufacturer, without further informa -
tion on the embedded software.
Requirements for SRASW
The requirements upon SRASW are geared to the PL that 
must be attained by the subsystem containing the pro -
grammable standard component. If for example a stan -
dard component is employed in one channel in diverse 
redundancy with a different technology (e.g. fluid power) 
in the other channel in Category 3 or 4, the IFA's recom -
mendation is that the requirements upon SRASW can be 
reduced by one PL level (e.g. from PL d to PL c) owing to 
the lower probability of a dangerous failure caused by 
systematic errors in the SRASW. This can be inferred from 
subclause 7 .4.3, “Synthesis of elements to achieve the \n726 Design of safe control systems
required systematic capability”, of IEC 61508-2 [48]. In 
the case of Category 2, only the requirements upon the 
SRASW of the test channel can be lowered. Further cases 
are described in IFA Report 2/2016 [43], Chapter 9. 
6.4 Combination of SRP/CSs as subsystems
Up to this point, this chapter has considered an SRP/CS 
only in the form of a complete control system that can 
be mapped in its entirety to a Category or designated 
architecture with a corresponding Performance Level. 
The safety function is executed entirely by such a control system, beginning with an initiating event through to 
attainment of the safe state. In reality however, it is often 
necessary for several SRP/CSs, each of which performs 
parts of the safety function, to be arranged in series as 
subsystems. Such subsystems may employ different 
technologies and/or implement different Categories or 
Performance Levels. Frequently, for example, different 
technologies are employed on the sensor/logic level (e.g. 
electronics in Category 3) to those on the drive level (e.g. 
hydraulics in Category 1), or bought-in devices are inter -
linked, e.g. light curtains, electronic controls and pneu -
matic valve level as shown in Figure 6.13.

One of the major advantages of the PL concept over the 
Categories is that it provides a method by which subsys -
tems of differing Category but similar Performance Level 
can be combined to form an overall system of mixed Cate -
gories but with a defined overall PL. In practice, different 
constellations may occur. These are discussed in greater 
detail below:
•	The entire control system in one Category, no subsys -
tems: for this case, the explanations given above apply, 
e.g. regarding the designated architectures.•	Control subsystem in one Category: for this case, the 
above explanations also apply, for example with regard 
to the designated architectures; the contribution to the 
safety function and the interfaces to which the further 
subsystems can be connected in order for the safety 
function to be completed must however be defined pre -
cisely (see below).
•	Arrangement of subsystems (e.g. of differing Category) 
in series: a method is described below by which the PL 
and the PFHD of the system as a whole can be calculated 
from the values for the subsystems (PL, average proba -\n736 Design of safe control systems
bility of a dangerous failure per hour PFHD). Here too, 
the precise definition of the contribution to the safety 
function and of the interfaces must be observed.
•	Integration of “encapsulated subsystems”, e.g. in the 
form of externally sourced subsystems for which, of 
the characteristic data for quantitative determining of 
the PL, only the PFHD and PL (or SIL) are known, and 
possibly informatively the Category (refer to subclause 
6.2.9 and Figure 6.14 in this context).
•	Treatment of special cases, such as the arrangement of 
subsystems in parallel or the use of subsystems in only 
one channel of an entire control system.
The arrangement in series of multiple subsystems, 
including subsystems differing in their technology, typi -
cally takes the form outlined by the example shown in 
Figure 6.13: the light curtain, electronic control system 
and pneumatic valve are arranged in series to enable 
them to perform the safety function (stopping of the 
hazardous movement in response to interruption of a 
light beam) together. The pneumatic cylinder itself is not 
a part of the control system and is not therefore subject to 
evaluation of its PL.
A chain is only ever as strong as its weakest link: this rule 
also applies to the interlinking of parts of control systems 
both of different Categories and of different Performance 
Levels. As has often been observed in practice, a hydrau -
lic control system of Category 1 may, owing to the high 
MTTFD of its components, exhibit a safety level compara -
ble to that of a Category 3 electronic control system with a 
medium DCavg and low MTTFD. Since positive and negative 
correction values for the Category are already reflected in 
the PL via the MTTFD and DCavg, the PL for the combination 
is geared to the lowest PL in the series arrangement, and 
not to the lowest individual Category. A rising number of 
control elements and their respective contributions to the 
PFHD also increases the overall probability of failure PFHD 
of the system as a whole. Consequently, the PL of the 
series arrangement can be reduced by a further level from 
the lowest subsystem PL if for example addition of the 
PFHD values causes the threshold of the PFHD to the next 
PL down to be crossed.
Values for the average probability of a dangerous failure 
per hour PFHD are normally available for all subsystems 
(values for SIL and PFHD to IEC 61508 [10] or IEC 62061 
[11] are also suitable). The PFHD relevant to the overall PL 
value can then be formed by summation of these values:
N
i=1PFHDi = PFHD1 + PFHD2 + ... + PFHNPFHD∑= (5)
where N = number of subsystems involved in the safety function
PFHD = average probability of a dangerous failure per hour 
in the system as a whole
PFHDi = average probability of a dangerous failure per hour 
of the ith subsystem
The overall PL is then limited by:
•	The lowest PL of all subsystems involved in the safety 
function (limitation by non-quantifiable aspects such as 
software and systematic capability)
•	 The PL determined in accordance with Table 6.1 on 
Page 40 from the PFHD calculated in accordance with 
Formula 5 (limitation by quantifiable aspects)
If – in rare cases – PFHD values of the subsystems involved 
in the safety function are not known, an approximate esti -
mate of the attained overall PL can be produced from the 
subsystem PL values by means of the following alternative 
method in EN ISO 13849-1:
•	The lowest PL of all subsystems arranged in series is 
first determined; this is PLlow.
•	The number of incidences of PLlow in the series arrange -
ment of the subsystems is then counted; this is Nlow.
•	The overall PL can then be determined from PLlow and 
Nlow  as shown in Table 6.7 .
In the method shown in Table 6.7 , a probability of failure 
of the subsystems that lies precisely in the middle of 
the valid range (on a logarithmic scale) is assumed by 
 approximation for the PLlow in question.

Since with both methods, all subsystem PLs are always 
at least as great as the overall PL, it is also ensured that 
all measures for non-quantifiable, qualitative aspects 
(e.g. systematic failures or software) are adequately 
considered in the combination. Particular attention must 
however be paid here to the interfaces between the sub -
systems:
•	All connections (e.g. conductors or data communication 
over bus systems) must already be considered in the PL 
of one of the subsystems involved, or faults in the con -
nections must be excluded or be negligible.
•	The subsystems arranged in series must be compatible 
at their interfaces. In other words, each output status of 
an actuating subsystem that signals the demand of the 
safety function must be a suitable initiating event for 
initiating the safe state of the downstream subsystem.
In two-channel systems connected in series, addition of 
the subsystem PFHD values may lead to minor arithmetic 
errors on the unsafe side. Strictly speaking, the two out -
puts of the first subsystem should additionally be read 
crossed over into the inputs of the second subsystem, 
and compared. Crossed-over doubling of the input infor -
mation, however, is often already implemented internally 
at the input level of the second subsystem. In order to 
prevent an unnecessarily high wiring overhead, the minor 
underestimation of the PFHD during addition is tolerable.
The rules described up to this point already enable sub -
systems to be combined much more flexibly than was 
possible by means of the categories as described in the 
first edition of the standard in the form of EN 954-1. These 
subsystems may differ widely in nature, for example with 
regard to their technology or Category, and may also be 
developed against other standards for the safety-related 
parts of machine controls that are based upon an SIL 
rather than a PL (see Figure 3.2).
Two-channel and (tested) single-channel parts may alter -
nate in linked subsystems. As an example, Figure 6.14 
shows an encapsulated logic subsystem (e.g. a safety 
PLC) to which two-channel input and output elements are 
connected. Since the hardware level is already abstrac -
ted in the safety-related block diagram, the order of the 
subsystems is in principle interchangeable. It is therefore 
recommended that subsystems sharing the same struc -
ture be grouped together, as shown in Figure 6.14. This 
makes calculation of the PL simpler, and unnecessary 
truncation effects, such as multiple capping of the MTTFD 
of a channel to 100 years, are avoided.
Special cases nevertheless remain for which only rough 
rules, if any, can be stated at this time. One special case 
concerns the arrangement of subsystems in parallel. In 
this case, simple, generic rules cannot be formulated either for the quantifiable aspects (e.g. Category 1 twice 
in parallel still does not equate to Category 3, since it 
lacks fault detection) or with regard to the qualitative 
aspects (e.g. systematic failures, software, common 
cause failure). Usually, the only solution is therefore a re-
evaluation of the entire system; in some cases it may be 
possible to exploit the intermediate results (e.g. the MTTFD 
or DC of blocks).
Figure 6.14:  
Mixed subsystems can be re-sorted in the safety-related block 
diagram, for example by priority being given to encapsulated 
subsystems (“L” in this case).

two SRP/CS as subsystems
A further special case is the integration of subsystems 
that already possess a PL (or SIL) or an average proba -
bility of dangerous failure per hour PFHD as blocks in an 
SRP/CS. As an approximate rule without inspection of the 
internal structure of the subsystem, the reciprocal of the 
average probability of a dangerous failure per hour PFHD 
may be substituted as the MTTFD for the block. Since any 
diagnostics measures of the subsystem that may have 
been implemented internally have already been consi-
dered in the probability of failure, only supplementary dia -
gnostics measures acting externally upon the subsystem 
may be considered for the DC of the block. More detailed 
information can be found in clause 2 of [32]. Clause 3 of 
this publication also addresses the case in which more 
than two functional channels are connected in parallel.
A further issue that may arise in this context concerns the 
assignment of a Category for a complete system that is \n756 Design of safe control systems
created in turn from subsystems for which the only avail-
able information is the average probability of dangerous 
failure per hour PFHD. Besides information on the internal 
structure, information on the MTTFD of each channel and 
on the DCavg, for which minimum requirements apply 
depending upon the Category, is also lacking in this case. 
The same principle therefore applies as to parallel arran -
gements: the only alternative to a very rough estimation is 
re-evaluation, possibly with exploitation of intermediate 
results obtained.
6.5 Determining the PL with reference to the 
example of a paper-cutting guillotine 
with diverse redundancy in the logic 
control (Category 4 – PL e)
This subclause supplements the general description with 
an illustration of how the PL is determined in practice. At 
the same time, the example described here in detail faci -
litates the reader's access to Chapter 8, which contains a 
large number of circuit examples for diverse PLs, Catego -
ries and forms of technology.
The text boxes with grey background shown below corres -
pond to the brief descriptions in the form used in Chapter 
8. Additional explanations are also provided; reference to 
them for each circuit example would be too protracted in 
Chapter 8.
6.5.1 Safety functions
The example control system for a paper-cutting guillotine 
described in Figure 5.7 is taken up again here. Of the 
seven safety functions stated there, the implementation 
of SF2, for which the required Performance Level was 
found to be PLr e, is described by way of example. Since 
the various safety functions may make use of the same 
components, all safety functions must be considered 
during implementation. For example, for safeguarding 
on the operator side, the product standard governing 
paper-cutting guillotines, EN 1010-3, requires electro-
sensitive protective equipment (ESPE, not shown here) for 
the safety function SF3, in addition to a two-hand control 
(THC).
Safety function (SF2):
•	Controlled location of the operator's hands outside 
the danger zone during a hazardous movement  6.5.2 Implementation
Where implementation takes the form of a two-hand 
control, this safety function can be described as fol -
lows: when at least one of the two actuators S1 and S2 
is released, the hazardous movement of the clamping 
bar and knife is interrupted, and both the clamping bar 
and the knife are returned to their initial positions by 
spring force. A restart is prevented until both actuators 
have been released and a new cycle initiated by the 
two-hand control. Controlled location of the operator's 
hands is achieved by means of two actuators that must 
be operated simultaneously for the machine to be star -
ted (for details, e.g. concerning immunity to defeating, 
see EN 574). The timing and logic of the electrical signals 
must be interpreted; a programmable electronic control 
system is a suitable solution for this purpose, and will 
generally also control the movement of the clamping 
bar and knife. Owing to the high forces required, these 
parts are driven hydraulically. As described in Chapter 5 
(see subclause 5.3.2), the safety function encompasses 
both actuators – clamping bar and knife – since they are 
located in the same hazard zone. Figure 6.15 represents 
an electrohydraulic conceptual schematic diagram show -
ing how the safety-related parts of control systems are 
implemented in practice. As in Chapter 8, many details 
have of course been omitted from the schematic diagram 
shown here in the interests of greater clarity. Besides the 
majority of functional parts of the control system required 
for operation of the machine within the process, certain 
safety-related details such as protective circuits (fuses, 
EMC) and “peripherals” (power supply, clock signals etc. 
for the logic) have also been omitted from the diagram. 
Owing to the required single-fault tolerance and tolerance 
of an accumulation of undetected faults, decoupling ele -
ments for example are also required in practice between 
the interconnected inputs of the two logic channels, in 
order for a defective input on one channel not to cause 
interference on the other channel. It must therefore be 
appreciated that a conceptual schematic diagram such 
as this does not constitute documentation from which a 
replica could be fabricated; rather, its purpose is to illus-
trate the structure of the safety technology.
6.5.3 Functional description
A functional description explaining the circuit structure 
and signal paths is essential for an understanding of the 
circuit diagram. It is intended to permit identification of 
the functional process during performance of the safety 
function (which may take place in different channels) and 
the implemented test measures.\n766 Design of safe control systems

Functional description:
•	Operation of the actuators S1 and S2 of the two-hand 
control initiates the hazardous movements (proces -
sing cycle) of the clamping bar and the knife. Should 
either of the actuators of the two-hand control be 
released during this cycle or a signal change occur 
in the peripheral system of the machine that is not 
expected by the control system, the cycle is halted 
and the machine assumes the safe state.
•	Pressing the actuators S1 and S2 causes the rising 
edges of the signals to be fed to the two processing 
channels K1 (microcontroller) and K2 (ASIC). Provided 
these signals satisfy the requirements for simul -
taneity (500 ms) in accordance with the relevant 
standard, EN 574, the two processing channels set 
the outputs (contactor relays K3 to K6) for a valid cut 
request.
•	The two processing channels act synchronously and 
also mutually evaluate internal intermediate states of 
the cyclical signal processing operations. Deviations 
from defined intermediate states cause the machine 
to be halted. One processing channel is formed by a 
microcontroller (K1), the other by an ASIC (K2). K1 and 
K2 perform background self-tests during operation.
•	Faults in the actuators S1/S2 and in contactor relays 
K3 to K6 (with mechanically linked readback contacts) 
are detected by cross monitoring in the processing 
channels.
•	Failure of the valves 1V3/1V4 and 2V1/2V2 is detected 
by means of the pressure switches 1S3 and 2S1.
•	Failure of the valves or sticking open of 1V4 or 2V2 is 
detected by a strong reduction in the return speed 
of the hydraulic cylinders. This situation can also be 
detected by the control system by suitable interpre -
tation of the pressure signals (duration of pressure 
drop).
•	Failure of the valves or sticking open of 1V3 or 2V1 is 
detected directly by monitoring of the signal change 
of pressure switches 1S3 and 2S1: should a valve 
stick, a pressure is signalled even though no pressure 
should be present.
•	All machine states are monitored by both processing 
channels. The cyclical nature of the cut operation cau -
ses all system states to be cycled through, and faults 
can thus be detected.  6.5.4   Safety-related block diagram
The description of the circuit arrangement in conjunc -
tion with the circuit diagram and where applicable other 
descriptive documents (comprehensive specification) 
enables a control Category to be determined and the 
actual circuit to be mapped to an abstracted safety-
related block diagram (Figure 6.16, see Page 78). It quickly 
becomes clear from this example that the safety function 
is executed in two-channel mode. Category 3 or 4 may 
therefore be considered. The high-quality test measures, 
by which combinations of faults can also be controlled, 
suggest Category 4. This is demonstrated explicitly by the 
verification step in Chapter 7 , as is checking of the quan -
titative requirements for the MTTFD, DCavg and CCF (see 
below). The explanations provided in subclauses 6.2.8 
and 6.2.9 are helpful for implementation in the safety-
related block diagram. A proven procedure is to track the 
signal path, beginning at the actuator end, by asking: 
“How is the hazardous movement driven/prevented?”, 
in order then to follow the logic through to the sensors. 
 SISTEMA Cookbook 1 [34] describes this step “From the 
schematic circuit diagram to the Performance Level” in 
more detail. Note in this example that actuators S1 and S2 
are not mutually redundant, even though they may initi -
ally appear so, since each button independently protects 
one of the user's hands. Rather, the redundancy begins 
within each button with the use of electrical break con -
tact/make contact combinations. Each control channel 
monitors both hands/actuators by interpreting at least 
one electrical switching contact in each actuator. The 
safety-related block diagram therefore contains a make 
contact, e.g. S1/13-14, and a break contact, e.g. S2/21-22, 
in each channel. The safety-related block diagram differs 
substantially in this respect from the functional circuit 
diagram.
Under certain circumstances, the actual implementation 
of the safety function may result in restrictions or recom -
mendations for the application. For example, the effec -
tiveness of fault detection by way of the work process is 
by definition closely related to the application.

DC can first be determined for the individual blocks, and 
the measures against CCF also evaluated for existing 
 redundancies. This is followed by the “mathematical” 
steps for determining the MTTFD of each channel, the 
DCavg, and finally the PL.
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	MTTFD: at 240 working days per year, 8 working hours 
per day and a cycle time of 80 seconds, nop is 86,400 
cycles per year. For S1 and S2 and for K3 to K6, a B10D 
value of 2,000,000 cycles [M] produces an MTTFD of 
232 years. For the microcontroller alone, an MTTFD of 
1,142 years is determined [D]. The same value is also 
substituted for the ASIC [D]. Together with the asso -
ciated circuit arrangement, this results in an MTTFD of 
806 years in each case for the blocks K1 and K2. The 
manufacturer states an MTTFD of 150 years [M] in each 
case for the hydraulic valves 1V3, 1V4, 2V1 and 2V2. 
These values result in an MTTFD for each channel of 
31.4 years (“high”).
•	DCavg: in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, Annex E, 
the DC values produced for S1/S2 are: 99% (cross 
monitoring of input signals without dynamic test with 
frequent signal change); for K1/K2: 90% (self-test by 
software and cross monitoring); for K3 to K6: 99% 
(direct monitoring by mechanically linked contacts); 
for 1V3/2V1: 99% (indirect monitoring by the pressure 
sensor); and for 1V4/2V2: 99% (indirect monitoring 
by the function and measurement of a change in the 
duration of the pressure drop). These values yield a 
DCavg of 98.6% (“high”).
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure 
(65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection 
etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	The combination of control elements satisfies Cate -
gory 4 with a high MTTFD per channel (31.4 years) and 
a DCavg of 98.6%, within the “high” tolerance band. 
This results in an average probability of dangerous 
failure of 9.7 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e.  In order to elucidate calculation of the MTTFD, block “K1” 
will first be considered: although the conceptual schema -
tic diagram (Figure 6.15) shows only the microcontroller, 
this block includes further elements that are necessary 
for the practical functionality (e.g. crystal oscillator). All 
elements the dangerous failure of which could prevent 
performance of the safety function in the affected channel 
must be considered. This generally encompasses all ele -
ments in the signal path critical to safety, e.g. for decoup -
ling, readback, EMC protection or protection against over -
voltage. These elements are generally necessary for the 
implementation of basic and well-tried safety principles or 
for attainment of the DC. Figure B.2 (see Page 253 shows 
this approach with reference to a further simple example. 
The parts count method shown in Table 6.8 is suitable for 
use as a simple tabular method for determining the block 
MTTFD based upon the element MTTFD. (For comparison, 
Figure B.3 on Page 255 shows the procedure for a failure 
mode and effects analysis.)
The failure rates for the elements stated in the second 
column were determined by means of the SN 29500 data -
base [49], as denoted by the code [D] under “calculation 
of the probability of failure” (see subclause 7 .6). Valida -
tion is described in greater detail in the continuation of 
this example in subclause 7 .6. Since identical elements 
may occur more than once (third column), the total failure 
rate for each element type is calculated and indicated in 
the fourth column. The global approximation that only half 
of the failures are dangerous yields the halved value in 
Column 5. Finally, simple summation produces the total 
rate of dangerous failures for block K1. Column 6 shows 
the associated MTTFD values in years, derived as the reci -
procals of the dangerous failure rates (from Column 5, 
following conversion from hours to years). This value is 
rounded to 806 years for block K1. Since the database 
employed states identical failure rates for the microcon -
troller and the ASIC and the circuitry is similar, the MTTFD 
value of 806 years also applies to block K2.\n796 Design of safe control systems

Manufacturers' data (“[M]”) are used for blocks S1/S2 and 
K3 to K6. Since the reliability data are available only for  
S1/S2 overall (operating mechanism and break and make 
contact), these values can be used as an estimation erring 
on the safe side for each of the channels, even though only either the make contacts (e.g. S1/13-14) or the break 
contacts (e.g. S2/21-22) are considered in each channel, 
in addition to the operating mechanism. The assumed 
B10D values are converted to MTTFD values by means of the 
formulae familiar from Annex D:

The operation time of electromechanical components is

med mission time of 20 years, it is not relevant for further 
analysis.

The manufacturer also states an MTTFD of 150 years [M] in

The measures against common cause failure (CCF) stated 
in the grey box on Page 78 are largely self-explanatory. 
Validation is nonetheless explained in greater detail in 
Chapter 7 . In addition, the “diversity” measure and the 
“use of well-tried components” measure take effect in 
the electrical and hydraulic subsystems respectively (see 
Annex F). With satisfaction of the requirements for CCF, a 
DCavg of “high” and an MTTFD of “high”, the quantitative 
requirements for Category 4 are also met.6.5.6 Several approaches for quantitative 
calculation of the PL
Determining of the PL on the basis of quantifiable aspects 
is now almost complete at this stage. The results for the 
Category, DCavg and MTTFD can be used for graphical confir -
mation by means of the bar chart that PL e is attained (see 
Figure 6.17). The tabular values in Annex K of the standard

The SISTEMA software (see Annex H), available free of 
charge from the IFA, is much more convenient for the 
administration, documentation and calculation of all 
intermediate results. All quantitative requirements for 
determining the PL that have been described thus far can 
be handled easily with this software, and all calculations 
including mathematical determining of the PL are auto -
mated. Use of the exact DCavg and MTTFD values for calcu -
lation is possible as a special option. For DCavg, the exact 
(in this case poorer) value of 98.6% is employed for cal -
culation rather than exploitation of the 5% tolerance for a 
DCavg of “high” and substitution of a rounded 99% (for the 
tolerances for DC and MTTFD, cf. Note 2 in Tables 4 and 5 of 
the standard). Dropping below the 99% mark for Category 
4, still within the tolerance band, initiates a warning mes -
sage by SISTEMA, however. Use of the precise MTTFD value 
of 31.4 years for calculation yields a result comparable to 
that from calculation with the rounded value of 30 years 
for MTTFD “high”. The result is an average probability of 
a dangerous failure per hour of 9.7 · 10-8 per hour (see 
Figure 6.18).
This is now followed by evaluation of the non-quantifiable 
qualitative aspects for determining the PL, firstly for syste -
matic failures.
6.5.7 Systematic failures
With its diversity-oriented approach for the logic control, 
the selected design of the control system employs a 
highly effective measure against the influence of syste -matic failures. Further measures are of course required 
in the course of implementation, for example in order to 
control the effects of a voltage breakdown, fluctuations 
in voltage, overvoltage and undervoltage. Some of the 
necessary measures are already evident in the selected 
design. These include:
•	Use of the closed-circuit current principle: this ensures 
that the de-energized state cannot give rise to an actua -
tion signal (e.g. in the event of wire breakage).
•	Fault detection by automatic tests: in this case, tests 
– differing between the two channels – are performed 
that are capable of detecting faults at an early stage and 
of initiating the safe state independently of the respec -
tive adjacent channel.
•	Testing by redundant hardware: the diversity by design 
provides additional control of faults caused by environ -
mental influences that differ in their effects upon the 
different channels.
•	Use of contactor relays with mechanically linked con -
tacts: status detection of suitable contacts enables dan -
gerous faults of the contactor relays and in some cases 
of other circuit components to be detected.
•	Program sequence monitoring: the ASIC for example is 
used to monitor the program sequence of the microcon -
troller channel.
Figure 6.18:  
Determining of the PL by means of SISTEMA  
\n826 Design of safe control systems
The reader's attention is drawn in particular to two details 
concerning systematic failures, the first relating to the 
application, the second to the design process:
•	During design of the hydraulic system for paper-cutting 
guillotines, consideration must be given to the inci -
dence of paper dust. Contamination of hydraulic fluid 
with paper dust may for example jeopardize the safe 
function of a paper-cutting guillotine. For this reason, 
particular attention must be paid to effective filtration of 
the pressure medium. In addition, the ingress of paper 
dust into the hydraulic system from outside must be 
prevented, for example by tank vent filters and wiper 
rings on cylinder rods.
•	Fault-avoidance measures during development of the 
ASIC in accordance with the ASIC development life cycle 
of IEC 61508-2. This standard makes provision for a 
V model for the development of an ASIC, following the 
V model familiar from software development.
6.5.8 Ergonomic aspects
In this example, a safety-related interface exists between 
the user and the control system: the two-hand control 
(THC) device, with actuators S1 and S2. Certain ergonomic 
aspects must be considered here in order to prevent any 
person from being endangered, either directly or over 
time as a result of impairing strain, during the intended 
use and reasonably foreseeable misuse of the machine. 
For the majority of machines, these user interfaces can 
be checked by means of the ergonomic machine design 
checklist, DGUV Informative publications 209-068 and 
209-069 [30]. Aspects to be observed in this context 
include the following:
•	Height and orientation of the actuators in relation to the 
operator 
•	 Legroom and area of reach during operation, normally 
in a standing position
•	 Arrangement matched to the operating task and good 
accessibility outside the danger zone
•	 Ease of observation of the cutting process from the 
location of the THC
•	Minimum dimensions and shape of the actuators  
(ergonomic design in consideration of the requirements 
of EN 574)
•	Easy operation with low forces, but with design meas-
ures for the prevention of unintended operation
•	 Robust design of the buttons, and suitable marking and 
colouring•	 THC designed to prevent defeating and thus circumven -
tion of the controlled location of the operator's hands
6.5.9 Requirements concerning the software, 
specifically SRESW
The following description is of a model implementation 
of safety-related firmware for the microcontroller K1. The 
software is embedded software (SRESW) for which the  PLr 
is e. Owing to the diversity-oriented approach of the logic 
control – the second channel takes the form of an ASIC 
– the requirements in accordance with the note in sub -
clause 4.6.2 of the standard can be scaled down: “ When 
using diversity in specification, design and coding, for the 
two channels used in SRP/CS with Category 3 or 4, PLr  e 
can be achieved with the above-mentioned measures for 
PLr of c or d .”
The design process for the firmware is based upon 
the V model in Figure 6.11, and is embedded in the 
manufacturer's certified quality management system. 
Based upon the specification for the safety-related con -
trol system as a whole, the specification for the software 
safety requirements for the firmware (safety related 
software requirements specification) is first written. This 
document describes the contribution made by the firm -
ware to the safety functions of the machine, the required 
response times with regard to K1, responses to detected 
faults, interfaces to other subsystems, dependencies 
upon operating modes, etc. In addition, all fault-avoi -
dance measures required under subclause 6.3.2 of the 
standard for PL c or d are defined. The specification is 
then reviewed, for example by the safety project manager, 
and amendments made if appropriate. Once the specifi -
cation has been approved, system design can commence.
Software architecture: an operating system is not 
in stalled on the microcontroller; instead, a number 
of tasks are defined which, controlled by simple task 
management, are executed by timer interrupt at defined 
intervals. Some low-priority tasks are reserved for the 
standard functions of the paper-cutting guillotine, whilst 
the high-priority tasks are executed by the safety-related 
functions specified above. The determinacy of these task 
calls is necessary for the required high synchronicity of 
the two channels and the short response times. The cyc -
lical self-tests for the control of random hardware failures 
are executed during task idle times.
The design of the software architecture and of the soft -
ware modules and functions required for implementation 
of the software described above are summarized in a 
further document, the technical specification for the 
system and module design. For fault avoidance over the 
entire life cycle, suitable modularization and in this case 
also clear separation of the SRESW from the non-safety-
related software are particularly important. Where neces -\n836 Design of safe control systems
sary for the sake of clarity, the structure and flow of the 
software are shown by diagrams. Further requirements 
are laid down concerning the programming language to 
be used, in this case ANSI C with compiler-specific lan -
guage extensions, and the development tools, e.g. compi -
ler, version management, configuration management; all 
have been used successfully for many years. The program -
ming guidelines and methods for tools-based static ana -
lysis for verification of coding are also specified. Planning 
of module and integration testing is also set out in this 
document. Following a further review, for example by the 
software development manager, the technical specifica -
tion is approved as a specification for coding. This review 
also verifies whether the requirements of the software 
specification are met.
Coding proper now begins, in compliance with the pro -
gramming guidelines. Besides rules for better code 
legibility, the provisions of the programming guidelines 
specify such things as constraints upon the use of critical 
language constructs. Observance of the programming 
guidelines during coding is assured in-process by the use 
of suitable tools. For semantic verification (of the content) 
of the finished code against the technical specification, 
the programmer conducts a walk-through with colleagues 
in which execution of the program and the data flow of 
critical signals are analysed at the same time.
The usual module tests are performed to check the func -
tions and interfaces, firstly for correctness and secondly 
for compliance with the module design. This is followed 
by integration of the software and tests together with the 
hardware of the microcontroller K1. K1 is then connected 
to the ASIC channel K2 in order to test synchronization, 
data exchange and fault detection of the two channels in 
combination. All tests are documented.
This integration test may reveal that the microcontroller's 
performance is not as good as previously assumed. 
Should this be the case, the software architecture, speci -
fically scheduling of the tasks and the assignment of func -
tions to them, must be modified. This would not result 
in changes to the specification of the software safety 
requirements; the system and module design, however, 
would have to be adapted and subjected once again to 
review in order to assure compliance with the specifica -
tion. This is one example of how technical changes which 
become necessary during development may result in the 
V model being repeated in order for the modifications to 
be implemented in accordance with the QA requirements. 
The code for such modifications would be written and 
both the module and integration tests would have to be 
repeated.
For the event of the firmware having to be modified after 
the first production batch has already been shipped, 
suitable measures such as an impact analysis of the modifications and appropriate development activities in 
accordance with the V model should be defined within the 
organization of development itself.
6.5.10 SRP/CS in combination
Since the entire SRP/CS are structured end-to-end in a 
single Category and no subsystems are combined, corres -
ponding analysis in accordance with subclause 6.4 is not 
required. It is obvious nevertheless that the various com -
ponents and technologies must be compatible at their 
interfaces. Validation aspects regarding integration are 
addressed in Chapter 7 .
6.5.11 Further details
Even in this detailed circuit example, numerous safety-
related design aspects can only be touched upon. A 
reference is therefore provided here, as in the majority of 
the circuit examples that follow, of useful reference con -
taining further explanations and referring to additional 
requirements.

(BGIA Report 2/2008e): 
•	The entire subclause has been comprehensively edi -
ted.
•	Further details on the typical content of the verifica -
tion and validation plan has been added to subclause 
7 .1.2. subclause 7 .1.3 now contains further information

documentation required for V&V activities have also 
been added in subclause 7 .1.4.
•	The information on verification of the specification and 
technical documentation have now been merged in a

•	Listing of required content has now been deleted for, 
subclause 7 .5 concerning the information for use. 
Instead, references are provided to standards gover -
ning the content and presentation of information for 
use.
 
Verification and validation refer to quality assurance 
measures for the avoidance of faults during the design 
and implementation of safety-related parts of control 
systems (SRP/CS) that perform safety functions. Part 2 of 
EN ISO 13849 [6] in particular deals comprehensively with 
this subject.
Verification  encompasses analyses and tests of SRP/CS 
and their sub-aspects that have the purpose of determi -
ning whether the results attained by a phase of design 
or development satisfy the requirements for the phase 
concerned, i.e. whether for example the circuit layout 
corresponds to the circuit design, or whether the require -
ments relevant to the intended applications are compiled 
comprehensively (in full) in the specification.
Validation  refers to demonstration of whether suitability 
is assured with regard to the imposed requirements. In 
other words, examination is performed during or at the 
end of the development/design process of whether the 
specified functional and design requirements upon the 
safety-related part of the machine control have in general 
been attained, or in the context of EN ISO 13849, whether 
the SRP/CS satisfies the relevant requirements of this 
standard for each safety function.•	Reference is made in subclause 7 .6 to the  
commissioning test.
•	The aspect of verification of the user interface is 
addressed by the new subclause 7 .7 , which follows the 
treatment of the subject in EN ISO 13849-2, 4.1. c).
•	The example of verification and validation of the paper-
cutting guillotine in subclause 7 .8 has been updated.
The report does not discuss the “Example of validation of 
fault behaviour and diagnostic means” addressed infor -
matively in the new Annex E of EN ISO 13849-2 [6].
Despite the dated reference in EN ISO 13849-2 [6] to 
ISO  13849-1:2006, this subclause of the report is also 
based upon the more recent edition of EN ISO 13849-
1:2015.
 
The process of assessment of a safety function in its 
implementation by SRP/CS is therefore a combination of 
verification and validation steps that deal with both the 
SRP/CS as a whole, and specific aspects of them. The 
terms verification and validation are also described below 
as V&V activities.
Note : this chapter (Chapter 7) addresses the verification 
and validation process for SRP/CS in the sense of a pro -
cess for demonstrating compliance with the standard 
EN ISO 13849. Details of the methods of stated V&V 
activities cannot be “taught” here, nor can all sub-tests 
required for conformity of the product with the Machinery 
Directive be discussed, such as those concerning pro -
tection against electric shock, the technical (electrical, 
hy draulic, pneumatic) equipment, or ergonomics.

Figure 7 .2 can be used for planning of the execution of 
V&V activities including the corresponding relevant tasks 
and a reasonable constructive procedure. The figure is 
taken from Part 2 of EN ISO 13849, but has been simpli -
fied graphically in order to present the V&V activities more 
clearly.
The most important aspects of the verification and valida -
tion procedure are explained below.
7 .1.1 Principles for verification and validation
Verification and validation are intended to assure con -
formity of the design of the SRP/CS with the reference 
standards. Since EN ISO 13849-1 is harmonized under 
the Machinery Directive as a Type B standard for machine 
controls, the V&V activities must demonstrate that each 
safety-related part and each of the safety functions that 
it performs satisfies the requirements of EN ISO 13849-1. The focus lies here upon the specified properties of the 
safety functions and the requirements for the specified 
Performance Level (refer also to subclauses 7 .3 and 7 .4). 
EN ISO 13849-2 also specifies that ergonomic design of 
the user interface(s) shall be addressed by the V&V pro -
cess.
These activities should be begun as early as possible 
during development/design, in order to detect and elimi -
nate faults and deviations to the specification in time. The 
personnel tasked with measures for verification and vali -
dation should if possible not be involved in the process 
of designing the safety-related parts, i.e. they should be 
able to act independently of the design and development 
process. The parties concerned may be other persons, 
departments or bodies that are not subordinate to the 
design department within the organization's hierarchy. 
The level of independence should be commensurate with 
the risk, i.e. the required Performance Level (PLr).\n877 Verification and validation

7 .1.2 Verification and validation plan 
A verification and validation plan has the purpose of 
describing execution of the V&V process for the specified 
safety functions, the safety integrity, and all operating 
and environmental influences that are to be taken into 
account. The “validation process” in accordance with 
EN ISO 13849-2, which of course also includes the verifi -
cation activities, assumes the generation of a verification 
and validation plan, but specifies neither its form nor its content in detail. All V&V activities accompanying the 
development/design process are set out in binding form 
in a verification and validation plan (V&V plan). The plan 
should contain the following information:
•	Identification of the SRP/CS under analysis, if appropri -
ate their components, and possible variants/variations
•	Identification of the safety functions with their assign -
ment to the SRP/CS involved
•	Reference list of all documents referred to (including 
the standards and technical rules to be applied) with \n887 Verification and validation
descriptions of the requirements, specifications , and 
obligations in the area of application for the SRP/CS 
under analysis, together with internal company design 
rules, such as company hardware design rules and pro -
gramming rules/guidance documents
•	Reference list of the test standards to be applied (i.e. 
standards governing test methods and performance 
of testing, not product requirements: for example, the 
IEC 60068 series governing environmental influences)
•	The analyses and tests to be performed; with additional 
information on the sequence in which the analysis and 
test methods are to be performed, where specified
•	Indication whether and if so what demonstrations of 
compliance already exist for individual components; 
including statement of the references to the legacy 
 certificates
•	Fault lists to be applied (refer also to subclause 7 .1.3 
and Annex C)
•	Further references to documents concerning the genera -
tion of confirmations, for example: QM manual, proce -
dural instructions, forms/samples for V&V activities
•	Personnel responsible for the respective analyses and 
tests (persons, department or body/test institute where 
applicable)
•	Specified (test) environment conditions and equip -
ment/test apparatus/tools/auxiliary equipment for 
performance of the analyses and tests, together with 
further operating conditions to be observed; this infor -
mation may also be listed in the documentation for the 
results of the individual V&V activities
•	The specified documentation of the test results (test 
reports/protocols) and detailed further documentation 
of performance of the V&V activities (e.g. test specifica -
tions, test case specifications, checklists)
•	Evaluation criteria for the analysis and test results, 
including the measures to be taken in the event of fail-
ure to pass an analysis/test
•	Formal aspects such as document identification, versio -
ning and modification history, authors/persons respon -
sible, release note(s), signature(s), etc.
The verification and validation plan should reasonably 
be generated at an early stage of development (recom -
mended: parallel to the specification), thereby delivering 
the full benefit for ongoing project management. It is 
also proven good practice to have the V&V plan reviewed or inspected by a person competent in issues of quality 
management (QM) and quality assurance (QA).
Where larger or more complex overall SRP/CS are being 
designed, an option is for the V&V plan to set out which 
validation activities are to be performed only once the 
systems concerned have been installed within a machine, 
or whether alternatively automatic test machinery or sub -
stitute simulators can be used (for example by means of 
“hardware in the loop” simulation).
7 .1.3 Fault lists
The V&V process must examine and demonstrate the fail-
ure mode behavior of the SRP/CS. The principles of fault 
analysis are stated in Annexes A to D of EN ISO 13849-2 
as faults to be considered (modes of failure) and fault 
exclusions. Annex C of the present report describes the 
subjects of fault lists, assumed faults/modes of failure 
and fault exclusions in detail. These general fault lists are 
based upon past experience. A small number of further 
standards, such as IEC 61800-5-2 [20] governing the 
functional safety of electrical power drive systems and 
IEC 61784-3 [39] governing functionally safe transmission 
on field buses, contain specialist fault lists. Annex A.2, 
Table A.1 of IEC 61508-2 governing the functional safety of 
programmable electronic systems also contains certain 
precise details of faults in CPU, RAM, ROM and clock. 
The fault model for highly integrated microelectronic 
components (microprocessors, DSPs, ASICs, FPGAs, 
SoCs etc.) is however generally somewhat abstract in its 
characterization. It is highly advantageous for standard 
elements (in both software and hardware) to be used for 
fault diagnostic measures (self-tests, monitoring routines, 
monitoring components), both for implementation and for 
demonstration. Examples of such standard elements are 
the standard CPU self-tests stated in BGIA Report 7/2006, 
Self-tests for microprocessors incorporating safety func -
tions [50]; RAM self-tests such as Galpat, March, Checker -
board, and numerous others; and commercial watchdog/
monitoring modules for IEC 61508/ISO 26262 applica -
tions. For components/elements not stated in the fault 
lists of EN ISO 13849-2, for example for novel technology, 
the manufacturer should add corresponding lists of faults 
and fault exclusions of his own. Where fault exclusions 
are assumed, they shall be supported by adequate rea -
soning. The fault lists supplemented by the manufacturer 
then form part of the technical documentation requiring 
review.
Fault lists exist in standards neither for SRESW nor SRASW 
(see subclause 6.3). In the general reference, too, soft -
ware faults are generally discussed with reference to 
examples rather than in the form of comprehensive fault 
lists. PC-based tools for static software analysis (for syn -
tax, semantic and code-rule testing) provide very useful 
support and comprehensive information on faults.\n897 Verification and validation
In principle, the same faults shall be considered with 
regard to common cause failures (CCF), in conjunction 
with the possible causes of CCF and the relevant counter -
measures stated in Annex F.
7 .1.4 Documents for V&V activities
As can be inferred from Figure 7 .1, detailed documentation 
is required for the execution of each V&V activity. This 
concerns technical documentation of relevance through-
out the V&V process (particularly the specifications), or 
documentation that has been produced in the course 
of design and creation of the SRP/CS and that may be 
required only for single or selected analyses/tests. The 
following content (summary) should be given adequate 
consideration:
•	Complete specification of the requirements upon the 
safety functions and of the requirements upon the 
design of the SRP/CS. The description of the require -
ments shall include all performance characteristics, 
properties, operating modes and anticipated states and 
processes from which evaluation criteria can be derived 
•	Operating and environmental conditions with rating 
data, derived from the intended applications or from 
the applicable standards; rating data for components
•	Functional description of the execution of all safety 
functions with description of states and processes: 
The handling of failures/faults in the SRP/CS, i.e. the 
responses to and states of the SRP/CS in the possible 
modes of failure/fault, shall be included, as shall the 
operating concept including all user interactions
•	Design description of the SRP/CS (with specifics of the 
mechanical, electrical, electronic, hydraulic and pneu -
matic components employed) by means of suitable 
drawings/sketches, diagrams, plans, data and explana -
tory text: This includes, for example, general drawings, 
structure and block diagrams, process/state transition 
diagrams, wiring plans, descriptions of connections 
and interfaces, conceptual schematic diagrams, circuit 
diagrams, electrical plans, fluid power circuit plans, 
assembly plans, tables of technical data/rating data for 
components, if applicable data sheets
•	Fault analysis/failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) 
or failure mode, effects and diagnostics analysis 
(FMEDA), in consideration of the applied fault lists; for 
Category 4, including accumulation of faults
•	Description of the technical measures taken for the con -
trol of faults (fault diagnostics measures) 
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles observed during 
the design process, and documented determining of the quantifiable aspects PFHD, MTTFD, DCavg and CCF for the 
Performance Level PL of each SRP/CS (quantification 
documentation), including the list of measures against 
common cause failures
•	Complete software documentation (refer also to sub -
clause 6.3)
•	Design rules followed for design and implementation, 
such as design rules for analog and digital circuits, pro -
gramming guidelines, etc.
•	Substantiating documentation (certificates, test 
reports, technical records) of components, units or  
SRP/CS that have already been validated. Also: sub-
stantiating documentation of attained reliability values 
where these were attained by means other than in 
accordance with EN ISO 13849. Data and where appli -
cable substantiating documentation concerning well-
tried components
The documents shall be complete, their content free of 
contradictions, logically structured, easily comprehen -
sible and verifiable.
7.1.5  Analysis
An SRP/CS or sub-aspects of it are evaluated largely by 
analysis. This entails both the use of analysis methods 
that can be performed manually, such as inspections, 
reviews or walk-throughs for the specification of technical 
documentation and of the accompanying information; 
and the use of analysis tools (often PC-based), such as 
circuit simulators, tools for static and dynamic hardware/
software analysis, or FMEA/FMEDA tools and fault simu -
lators for the analysis of components and circuits in fault 
mode. Verification concerning operating and environmen -
tal conditions pushes the scope of analysis to its limits. 
New methods and processes in product development 
(such as model-based or virtual development methods) 
will doubtless lead to the appearance of new analysis 
methods and analysis tools. The necessary decision regar -
ding where analytical methods shall be accompanied by 
tests is documented in simple form in the V&V plan.
7 .1.6 Tests
Wherever analyses are not possible for the sub-aspect 
under consideration or evaluation by analysis alone is not 
adequate, tests shall be performed in order to demon-
strate that the requirements are met. Testing shall be 
planned systematically and executed logically, generally 
with reference to development stages that can be imple -
mented in practice, such asprototypes, functional models 
or software/code. The tests shall be performed on a confi -
guration resembling the intended operating configuration 
as closely as possible. The environmental conditions \n907 Verification and validation
under which the tests are to be performed shall be defi -
ned in advance. The tests may be performed either manu -
ally or automatically.
Where testing is employed for verification, the meas-
urement uncertainty shall be reasonable. EN ISO 13849-2 
provides information on the limits that are to be obser -
ved.
Subclauses 7 .3 to 7 .7 describe the typical V&V activities 
of the individual aspects: safety functions, PL, Category, 
MTTFD, DC and CCF, software, user information and user 
interface; subclause 7 .8 then describes them with refe -
rence to the example of a paper-cutting guillotine.
7 .1.7 Documentation of results
All analysis and test activities shall be documented 
together with their results. During documentation of the 
results, it is important that the technical specifications 
and assessment standards referred to are dated or refe -
renced by versioning; that the item under analysis/under 
test (document, software, test specimen, etc.) is uniquely 
identified; that selected configurations are recorded; that 
the analysis/test conditions including their setup and 
procedure are included; and that all verification/valida -
tion points/cases are recorded together with the results. 
Formal information such as document identifiers, persons 
performing the test/analysis, date, signature, etc. shall 
of course be documented. Depending upon the level of 
automation and the tools and equipment used for the 
V&V measure, the documentation of the results will vary. 
The content referred to above should however be regar -
ded as the minimum scope of documentation. Documen -
tation management consistent with the need arising from 
the V&V process is therefore appropriate. Support and 
resources of any kind used for this purpose, ranging from 
record forms to document management systems, may be 
considered valuable.
7 .1.8 Completion or iteration
The combination of different SRP/CS involved in a safety 
function attains a Performance Level PL. At the end of the 
V&V process, this PL shall be compared to the required 
Performance Level PLr for the safety function in question. 
An adequate safety quality has been attained when the 
evaluation of “PL ≥ PLr?” as shown in Figure 7 .2 yields a 
positive result.
If the requirements set out in the specification of the SRP/
CS are not met in full, the design and implementation pro -
cess shall also be reverted to at this stage. If the V&V acti -
vities for all safety functions have been completed with a 
positive result, evaluation of the SRP/CS is deemed by the 
standard to have been completed. If not, the V&V process shall be continued with respect to the as-yet unresolved 
safety functions.
Returning to the design and implementation process also 
means identifying the elements of the V&V process that 
were not passed and assigning them to V&V activities to 
which they must once again be subjected. For this pur -
pose, the V&V plan (see subclause 7 .1.2) may contain sui -
table elements, and entries be made in it.
The scenario of negative results shall therefore be 
addressed in the processes of SRP/CS design and deve -
lopment. Accordingly, processes and measures for the 
management of defective software are required (for docu -
ments, records, data, configurations, software, samples/
prototypes, etc.).
7 .2 Verification of the specification and the 
technical documentation
By a wide margin, the document most frequently named 
(not only in this report) with respect to implementation 
of an SRP/CS is the specification. This refers to the spe -
cification of all requirements (technical specification), 
specification of the safety functions, specification of the 
design (with respect of course to safety) with its focus 
upon software integrity, and specification of the intended 
operating, environmental and application conditions. 
Chapter 6 of this report, specifically Box 6.1, contains 
comprehensive information on the required content of the 
technical specification. The use of computer-aided spe -
cification tools and formal methods for the generation of 
the specification is possible, albeit unusual. 
Verification thus addresses the “specification” document 
and takes the form of inspection and review. Division of 
the procedure into two parts has proved effective. Verifi -
cation is first performed by experienced personnel in the 
manufacturer's operation. This is followed by verification 
by a competent external body, such as a test institute.
Verification of the entire development and design docu -
mentation is covered by clause 12 of EN ISO 13849-2. This 
clause is cross-referenced to the required content of the 
technical documentation (clause10 of the standard). Ana -
lyses are suitable activities for verification of the deve -
lopment/design documents (technical documentation). 
Inspection, review and walk-through constitute typical 
methods for this purpose; refer necessary for example to 
IEC 61508-7 [10].
7 .3 Validation of the safety function
Validation of the implemented safety function(s) encom -
passes the activities that demonstrate full compliance 
with the functional characteristics and performance crite -
ria set out in the specification. Review of implementation \n917 Verification and validation
of the points listed in subclause 5.3.1 regarding the speci -
fication of safety functions is also useful for determining 
whether the safety function(s) have been correctly defi -
ned and implemented.
To permit an evidence of whether the functional require -
ments have been met, the following sub-tests shall be 
performed:
•	functional test
•	Extended functional test of the behaviour of the SRP/
CS in response to input signals, operator processes 
or inputs that are atypical, unexpected, procedurally 
in correct, or lie outside the specification (are invalid)
•	Simulation (where possible)
•	Performance tests (functional parameters, response 
time, etc.)
However, final assessment of proper integration of all 
safety functions on the complete machine includes a 
series of further aspects, such as the dimensioning of 
overruns and safety clearances.
7 .4 Verification of the PL of the SRP/CS
This subclause describes the activities normally per -
formed for demonstration of the attained Performance 
Level PL of a single SRP/CS. The procedure to be followed 
for combinations of several SRP/CS is explained in sub -
clause 7 .6.
The PL of an SRP/CS is determined on the one hand by 
quantifiable aspects/values such as the MTTFD, DC, CCF 
and the Category, and on the other by qualitative aspects 
such as the behaviour under fault conditions of the safety 
function, the design measures for the safety-related soft -
ware and systematic failures, and the functional beha -
viour under the anticipated (maximum) operating and 
environmental conditions. Evaluation of the individual 
aspects is followed by a description of a procedure for 
checking the estimation of the PL. Like EN ISO 13849-1 
and -2, the present report and this subclause assume that 
the “simplified method” is selected for estimation of the 
PL. This method has already been described.behaviour
7 .4.1 Verification of the Category
The objective of verifying the Category is to confirm that 
all requirements placed upon the Category are met in the 
development step under analysis; refer to subclauses 
6.2.2 to 6.2.7 in the behaviourpresent report and sub-
clauses 9.2.1 to 9.2.5 in [6]. The following analyses shall be performed:
•	Structure and signal path analysis of the technical cir -
cuit documentation
•	Evaluation of implementation and effectiveness of the 
fault diagnostics measures
•	Inspection of the observance of basic safety principles
•	Inspection of the implementation of well-tried safety 
principles (Category 1 and higher)
•	Inspection of the use of well-tried components (Cate -
gory 1 only)
•	Evaluation of faults to be analysed and permissible fault 
exclusions including their reasoning where added to 
fault lists on a case-by-case basis
The annexes in Part 2 of the standard, and also Annex C of 
this report, provide detailed assistance in execution of the 
last four of the analyses stated.
The following sub-tests shall be added if the preceding 
analyses are not sufficient or fault analyses performed on 
the test specimen are to be confirmed:
•	Tests of the behaviour under fault conditions of the 
SRP/CS with fault injection, i.e. testing of the safety 
functions under fault conditions (test of the effect of 
 failure); alternatively, fault simulation where the test 
cases with fault injection are not practicable
•	Use of extended functional tests to test the behaviour 
of the SRP/CS in the event of input signal states that 
are rare, unexpected, lie outside the specification or 
are defective, and defective processes/inputs during 
operation
7 .4.2 Verification of the MTTFD values
The MTTFD values employed for determining of the PL 
should be checked at least for plausibility. This typically 
includes evaluation of whether suitable sources are sta -
ted for the origin of the values. Review of the precise rea -
soning given for the values is also recommended for the 
dominant components and otherwise by random selec -
tion for all other components. The data sources stated in 
subclause 6.2.12 and Annex D can for example be used for 
this purpose. Suitable determining of the B10D, T10D and nop 
values is verified analytically, and correct calculation sub -
sequently checked, at least for plausibility.\n927 Verification and validation
7 .4.3 Verification of the DC values
The diagnostic coverage ( DC) assigned to the blocks or, 
where applicable, components shall be dimensioned 
reproducibly. Here too, the stated origin of the values and 
the reasoning for them is typically analysed. Annex E pro -
vides guidance concerning estimation of the DC values. 
This can also serve as a basis for verification.
The implemented design shall be analysed regarding 
whether the fault diagnostics measures described have 
been implemented. For this purpose, it is generally neces -
sary for the fault diagnostics functions and modules to 
be identified in the development documentation, and 
toestimate their effectiveness . In addition, tests of the 
behaviour under fault conditions of the SRP/CS (failure 
mode and effects testing/testing by fault injection) should 
show that proper fault detection is assured by the fault 
diagnostics functions. Finally, calculation of the DCavg is to 
be checked at least for plausibility.
7 .4.4 Verification of the measures against CCF
EN ISO 13849-1, Annex F contains a points-based method 
for evaluation of the selected measures against common 
cause failures (CCF). Besides checking of attainment 
of the total number of points and clarification that the 
selected measures are described comprehensively in the 
associated documents, analysis or testing shows that the 
measures have actually been implemented. The typical 
V&V activities employed for this purpose include static 
hardware analysis and functional testing under environ -
mental conditions (limit conditions).
7 .4.5 Verification of the technical measures 
against systematic failures
V&V activities concerning technical measures for the 
 avoidance and control of systematic failures assess 
 whether the required design measures described in  
EN ISO 13849-1, Annex G and explained further in sub -
clause 6.1.2 of this report have been implemented. Con-
firmation can typically be provided by:
•	Functional testing at limit values and with modified 
rated values, and failure mode and effects testing/tes -
ting by fault injection on the supply units (e.g. voltage 
breakdown, voltage fluctuation, overvoltage, undervol -
tage, changes in AC current and frequency, clock change 
and other phenomena and operating stresses that may 
lead to failure) 
•	Testing of the resistance to interference caused by 
ambient influences, i.e. functional testing under spe -
cified environmental conditions (climatic conditions, 
mechanical stress, electromagnetic compatibility, etc.); 
see clause 10 in [6]•	Analysis of implementation of program execution moni -
toring
•	Inspection and testing of the safety-related properties 
of data communications systems; where used, identifi -
cation of certified components
•	Inspection of development documents that confirm the 
application of basic and well-tried safety principles and 
further measures taken, such as hardware diversity
The present report does not address the evaluations of 
organizational measures required by EN ISO 13849-2 [6] 
for the avoidance of systematic failures, such as quality 
management systems for the manufacturing process (sub -
clause 9.4 e in [6]).
7 .4.6 Verification and validation of the 
 software
The verification activities performed in the course of spe -
cification, design and coding of the software (inspection/
review for software specification, software design and 
code, static software analysis, module test, software 
simulation, integration test) have already been described 
comprehensively in subclause 6.3. For verification of the 
software, too, graded software design measures shall be 
specified in this context according to the PL to be attai -
ned.
The final development activity in the simplified “V model” 
is that of software validation. Whether the requirements 
stated in the safety-related software specification con -
cerning the functional behaviour and the performance 
criteria (e.g. time-related specifications) have been imple -
mented correctly shall be examined. At this stage, vali -
dation no longer considers the internal workings of the 
software, but its “external” behaviour, i.e. the behaviour 
at the output in response to changes at the inputs, with 
the complete software integrated into the hardware. The 
software is considered here as a “black box”, and is vali -
dated by the “black-box test”. Supplementary I/O tests 
ensure that the safety-related input and output signals 
are used correctly. The functional test is then performed 
at system level (on the SRP/CS). Performance of an exten -
ded test case with (possibly simulated) fault cases serves 
to demonstrate the effectiveness and correct implementa -
tion of fault detection and fault handling (reaction in the 
event of a fault) implemented by the software.
Individual software functions that have already been cer -
tified or validated by quality assurance measures in the 
form of safety function blocks do not require re-testing. 
Evidence shall however be furnished that validation has 
already been performed. Where a number of such safety 
function blocks are combined for a specific project, how -\n937 Verification and validation
ever, the resulting safety function shall be validated as a 
whole.
In the particular case of SRESW used in SRP/CS with PL e 
and not developed with diversity for the two channels, the 
requirements for SIL 3 set out in clause 7 of IEC 61508-3 
[42] shall be satisfied in full during software development. 
This includes the V&V activities required in the clauses 
concerned.
Should the safety-related software subsequently be modi -
fied, it shall be reverified and revalidated on an appropri -
ate scale. The verification and validation plan described 
in subclause 7 .1.2 can and should serve as an aid to plan -
ning for this purpose.
A further area of software verification concerns configura -
ble, parameterizable and programmable SRP/CS. Where 
parameterization and programmability are software-
based, implementation and effectiveness of the measures 
shall also be demonstrated consistent with the require -
ments of EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 4.6.4, and thus with 
the configuration tools employed (parameterization/
programming programs where applicable) as a mandatory 
part of the V&V activities. These activities involve both 
analyses of the documentation of these tools and tests on 
the items themselves.
7 .4.7 Checking of the assessment of the PL
Checking that the PL has been assessed properly for each 
SRP/CS particularly entails comprehension of proper 
application of the assessment method employed, inclu -
ding correct calculations. 
If the PL was assessed by means of the simplified pro -
cedure, a check can be performed with reference to 
Figure 6.10 of whether the correct PL for the SRP/CS was 
determined from the Category, MTTFD and DCavg values 
confirmed beforehand.
7 .5 Verification of the information for use
Important information on safe use of the SRP/CS shall 
be made available in the form of instruction handbooks, 
assembly instructions, rating plates and maintenance 
instructions. These documentation elements, de  scribed 
in their entirety as the information for use, and accor -
ding to the Machinery Directive, also including the sales 
 brochures(!), shall be evaluated to ascertain whether 
they include all the content stated in clauses 9 and 11 of 
EN ISO 13849-1. EN ISO 13849 does not set out any rules 
of its own concerning the form of the documentation 
(language, digital or print form). The requirements (and 
committee decisions) at the level of the Machinery Direc -
tive apply. General guiding principles such as those of 
IEC 82079-1, Preparation of instructions for use [51], can be followed for the presentation (layout, typography, etc.) 
of information for use. Their application during evaluation 
is however not mandatory. Information supplied with the 
product is usually analysed by inspection and/or review.
7 .6 Validation of the combination and 
integration of SRP/CS
Individual SRP/CS shall be validated separately prior to 
combination. In order for systematic faults to be avoided 
during the combination/integration of SRP/CS, the fol -
lowing V&V activities shall be performed:
•	Inspection of the design documents that altogether 
describe implementation of the safety function con-
cerned 
•	Comparison of the characteristic data for the interfaces 
between the SRP/CS (e.g. voltages, currents, pressures, 
information data)
•	FMEA/fault analysis of the combination/integration
•	Functional test
•	Extended functional test
•	Checking of simplified determining of the overall PL 
from the PLs of the individual SRP/CS, as described in 
subclause 6.4.
Integration of (multiple) SRP/CS is not – yet – synony -
mous with their commissioning with the associated com -
missioning tests on a machine. The validation activities 
stated here, supplemented by the highly advantageous 
interface test/“I/O test”, are however suitable for this 
purpose without restriction.
Retrofitting safety technology or integrating new SRP/CS 
into existing machine controls may present a particular 
challenge. Planning of the above V&V activities in good 
time, applying them thoroughly irrespective of the pres-
sures that may arise, possibly not before installation on 
site, and documenting the activities from end to end con -
tribute substantially to SRP/CS being integrated reliably.
7 .7 Verification of the user interface 
(ergonomic design)
Requirements set out in EN ISO 13849 concerning the 
ergonomics of the user interface refer to universal design 
targets such as the prevention of hazardous action, cir -
cumvention/manipulation of the SRP/CS, general ergo -
nomic principles such as simplicity, and the ergonomic 
principles referenced in EN ISO 12100 [3] and ISO 9355 
[52]. At the same time, it explicitly requires consideration 
to be given to foreseeable incorrect operation.\n947 Verification and validation
If further guidance documents are required for verification 
of the user interfaces, application of design guidelines 
such as the following may be advantageous: VDI/VDE 
3850, Development of usable user interfaces for technical 
plants [31]; the VDMA guide to software ergonomics and 
the design of user interfaces [53]; and EN ISO 9241-11, 
Ergonomics of human-system interaction – Part 11: Usabi -
lity [54].
Finally, this subclause is intended to confirm the view 
that the use of SRP/CS – and also software modules and 
tools – that have already been certified or type-examined 
considerably simplifies and accelerates verification and 
validation of circuitry for safety functions.
7 .8 Verification and validation with 
reference to the example of a paper 
cutting guillotine with diverse 
redundancy in the logic control 
(Category 4 – PL e)
The general description of verification and validation of 
safety functions and PL is supplemented in this subclause 
by an explanation of the V&V activities for the practical 
example of the paper cutting guillotine described in sub -
clauses 5.7 and 6.5. It is assumed at this point that all 
necessary documents and a prototype of the machine are 
available. Based upon the documents, the steps of veri -
fication and validation will be shown here for a represen -
tative example of the safety functions, “SF2 – Con trolled 
location of the operator's hands outside the danger zone 
during a hazardous movement” (subclause 5.7 .3). The 
available documents include the verification and valida -
tion plan, which describes the activities required in the 
various phases (subclause 7 .1.2). Owing to the level of 
the hazard potential, it is advisable to have the work per -
formed by independent persons, for example from a diffe -
rent department (subclause 7 .1.1).
This subclause observes the definition of verification 
and validation stated in the introduction in clause 7 . Fre -
quently however, the boundaries are blurred, and precise 
classification difficult. An example is testing, for example 
of software. These tests are also referred to in the refe -
rence as validation, the purpose of which is to determine 
whether the program or parts of it fulfil their function (as 
stated in the specification). These steps could also be 
described as verification.
7 .8.1 Verification of the attained PL  
(refer also to Block 6 in Figure 7 .1)
An estimation of the risk showed that a Performance Level 
PLr of e shall be attained for the desired safety function 
SF2. This analysis is consistent with the requirement in 
EN 1010-1 [28], which further details the technical require -ments with reference to the requirements of the relevant 
standard governing two-hand controls, EN 574 [55]. The 
underlying conditions to be met are stated in the system 
specification and confirmed by validation. The verification 
now being performed confirms proper implementation 
of the terms, in this case by calculation of the PL with the 
aid of the SISTEMA software tool. This PL is attained in the 
calculation of the probability of failure in consideration 
of all quantifiable aspects. All requirements concerning 
the qualitative aspects, such as the behaviour under fault 
conditions of the safety function, including the measu -
res for fault detection implemented in the safety-related 
software, the measures against systematic failures and 
the behaviour under environmental conditions, are also 
adequately met for PL e.
The above conclusions were clearly reached at different 
points in time during development, or could in fact only 
have been reached during certain phases. Demonstration 
of satisfaction of the EMC requirements, for example, is 
not possible until a prototype has been fabricated. 
The validation/verification activities below do not consti -
tute a sequence that must be strictly followed. Rather, the 
intention here is to demonstrate the work entailed by the 
relevant phases of the V&V model with reference to the 
example of the SF2.
7 .8.2 Validation of the safety-related require -
ments (refer also to Block 7 in Figure 7 .1)
Fault lists
The PL is determined based upon the fault lists according 
to EN ISO 13849-2 [6].
Documents
As already stated in subclause 7 .1.4, analysis/testing is 
conducted with reference among other things to circuit 
diagrams, parts lists, the complete specification, functio -
nal description, and also the design description, fault/
failure mode effects analysis, the software specification 
and software documentation. 
Documentation
All analysis and test results shall be documented in wri -
ting. The criteria for evaluation of whether a test has or 
has not been passed are important and are contained in 
the verification and validation plan.
Validation of the safety function
In order to check the functional requirements upon the 
safety function, a functional test is performed, supple -
mented by an extended functional test for testing of the \n957 Verification and validation
behaviour of the safety function in response to rare or 
non-defined inputs. A possible example of such a test is 
testing of the response of the SRP/CS when a valid cut 
request from the two-hand control is accompanied by a 
fault signal, for example on peripheral equipment or initi -
ated by a stop command from a light curtain. Performance 
tests of functional aspects are also conducted. These 
include, for example, a check of the time to be observed 
for synchronous actuation in accordance with EN 574 
[55]. Only when the two actuators S1 and S2 are operated 
within an interval of ≤ 0.5 seconds may output signals be 
generated for actuation of the clamping bar and the knife.
The tests and analyses stated above for the specified 
safety characteristics have been passed.
Verification of the PL of the SRP/CS
•	Verification of the Category
The essential terms of reference for the Category of the 
SRP/CS are laid down at an early stage of development, 
based upon the complete or binding specification. 
Category 4 was also selected for the determined PLr e. 
Verification of the specification showed that the circuit 
structure based upon it (diverse redundancy, see also 
subclause 6.5.2) satisfies the requirements for a Cate -
gory 4. 
For the two-hand control, as envisaged in this case, 
tests of the behaviour under fault conditions are perfor -
med on a prototype with reference to the development 
documentation. This verifies whether the requirements 
overall for a Category 4 are also met in this case. Testing 
is performed by the controlled injection of faults. The 
SRP/CS shall respond to the injected faults in the man -
ner specified. An analysis is first performed, followed by 
testing, to ascertain the behaviour when, for example, 
individual contactor relays are no longer capable of 
executing switching commands, or of how the SRP/CS 
react when one of the two actuators S1 or S2 is actuated 
with a delay, or not at all. The safety function shall be 
assured at all times when a single fault is injected into 
the SRP/CS. A single fault shall be detected at or prior 
to the next execution of the safety function. Should the 
fault not be detected, an accumulation of further faults 
shall not result in loss of the safety function. The expec -
ted safe response for each injected fault is described 
in the associated test protocol and the behaviour of 
the SRP/CS commented with the evaluation criterion of 
“passed” or “not passed”.
Observance of the de-energization principle as an 
example of basic safety principles can be demonstrated 
by the injection of interruptions and evaluation of the 
response to them. Should for example the supply vol -tage fail, the clamping bar and the knife are returned to 
their initial positions by spring force.
Plausibility tests can be cited in this context as an 
example of well-tried safety principles: mechanically 
linked contacts in the contactor relays K3 to K6 are read 
back by both channels. Tests are performed to demon-
strate proper functioning of readback.
•	Verification of the MTTFD values
The value of 150 years, substituted for the valves 1V3, 
1V4, 2V2 and 2V1, is considered here by way of example 
for verification of the MTTFD values (see Figure 6.15). The 
manufacturer's figure was obtained from a reliable source, 
and its plausibility was confirmed by comparison with the 
corresponding value in Table C.1 of EN ISO 13849-1 [5] (see 
Table D.2 of the present report). The conditions stated by
Design features 
•	The requirements of Category B, basic and well-tried 
safety principles, are observed. Owing to diversely 
redundant processing channels (microcontroller 
and ASIC), a single fault does not result in loss of 
the safety function, and systematic faults are largely 
 prevented.
•	The safety-oriented switching position is assumed 
from any position by cancellation of the control 
 signal.
•	All electrical signals, including those of the pressure 
sensors, are processed in a multi-channel control 
system.
•	The actuators S1 and S2 of the two-hand control 
satisfy IEC 60947-5-1.
•	K3 to K6 possess mechanically linked contacts accor -
ding to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L [56]. The associated 
break contacts for monitoring of the make contacts 
are monitored in the respective adjacent channel.
•	All conductors carrying signals are laid either separa -
tely or with protection against mechanical damage.
•	The software (SRESW) is programmed in accordance 
with the requirements for PL d (downgraded owing to 
diversity) and the guidance in subclause 6.3.
•	Fault-avoidance measures in development of the ASIC 
are performed in accordance with the ASIC develop -
ment life cycle (V model) of IEC 61508-2 [48].  \n967 Verification and validation
the manufacturer for assumption of the MTTFD value (e.g. 
oil changes) are described in the instruction handbook 
and it is assumed that these conditions are observed in 
operation. 
•	Verification of the DC values
A DC of 90% is confirmed for K1 and K2, based upon 
self-diagnostics. This includes a cross monitoring of 
input signals and intermediate results (from the micro -
controller and the ASIC), monitoring of the timing and 
logic of program execution, and detection of static 
internal and peripheral failures. Further tests are a CPU 
test in the channel containing the microcontroller, in 
which all commands used are tested, and tests of ade -
quate quality of the random-access memory (RAM) and 
read-only memory (ROM). Tests of comparable quality 
to those in the parallel channel are performed in the 
second channel (ASIC). It shall be demonstrated by 
verification that the measures described in the specifi -
cation have been implemented correctly.
The contactor relays K3, K4, K5 and K6 are assigned a 
DC of 99%. This is appropriate owing to the plausibility 
testing by readback of the mechanically linked con -
tacts of the contactor relays. The plausibility tests that 
have already been checked during verification of the 
Category also serve at this point to demonstrate proper 
operation.
The pushbuttons S1 and S2 are assigned a DC of 99%. 
The reasoning for this is cross monitoring and a fre -
quent signal change. This assumption is confirmed by 
verification. This assumption will be proven by a fault-
case test at another point.
The valves 2V1, 2V2, 1V3 and 1V4 are monitored cycli -
cally indirectly by the pressure switches 2S1 and 1S3. 
Since the positions of the valves can be queried for 
their plausibility parallel to the machine cycle, a value 
of 99% for the DC is regarded as reasoned. Here too, the 
assumption is confirmed on the prototype by fault tests 
on the valves.
•	Verification of the measures against CCF
The minimum requirements for measures against com -
mon cause failure are satisfied, with at least 65 points. 
Further measures are also effective in parts of the 
control system. 15 points are allowed for implementa -
tion of the measure “physical separation between the 
signal paths”. Correct implementation of the measure 
shall be demonstrated by an analysis of development 
documentation such as circuit diagrams, and by tests 
on the hardware. The diversity employed for K1 and K2 
makes a substantial contribution to the CCF: the diffe -rent technologies of K1 and K2 are the reasoning for the 
20 points assigned for diversity.
•	Verification of the measures against systematic failures
The observance of basic and well-tried safety principles 
is a highly effective measure against systematic fail-
ures. The activities for verification of the Category also 
encompass checking of whether both types of safety 
principle have been observed. The results of the analy -
ses and tests performed for that purpose can thus also 
be used for assessment in this phase.
Besides the tests, an inspection is performed during 
development of the documentation describing the 
basic and well-tried safety principles applied and the 
measures for the control and avoidance of systematic 
failures according to subclause 6.1.2 of this report and 
Annex G of the standard. The purpose of this inspection 
is assessment of whether the principles and measures 
have been adequately considered during the develop -
ment process.
An example of the control of systematic system failures 
is that the safety-related software monitors execution 
of the program sequence for errors. The effectiveness of 
process monitoring is tested by injected faults.
In order to demonstrate the capacity of the SRP/CS to 
withstand the specified environmental conditions, tests 
are performed under all anticipated and predictable 
adverse conditions for factors including temperature, 
humidity and electromagnetic interference. This con -
stitutes an example of a measure for the avoidance of 
systematic failures. The limits for the temperature and 
humidity under which the paper-cutting guillotine may 
be operated are set out in the specification, which is 
confirmed by verification of the document.
•	Verification of the software
Development and validation of the software are 
described in detail in subclause 6.3. At this point, the 
software is also verified, i.e. testing is performed of 
proper operation and also of the response times of the 
software integrated in the hardware. Testing takes the 
form of functional tests (black box tests) and extended 
functional tests in which firstly, the safety-related input 
signals shall be processed correctly to safety-related 
output signals, and secondly, test cases with injected 
faults are executed in order to verify the specified fault-
mode responses of the firmware of the microcontroller 
K1. In other words: it is clarified whether the require -
ments of the specification have been implemented 
 correctly in the software.\n977 Verification and validation
•	Checking of the assessment of the PL
The simplified procedure according to EN ISO 13849-1 
was applied for estimation of the PL. Its correct 
application is confirmed. Calculation of the MTTFD in 
accordance with subclause 6.2.11 and Annex D and of 
the average diagnostic coverage DCavg in accordance 
with Annex E is checked, as is correct determining of the 
PL from the previously confirmed Category, MTTFD, and 
DCavg values by means of the bar chart shown in Figure 
6.10.
•	Verification of the information for use
The information for use shall be reviewed concerning 
the two-hand control. This also includes explanation of 
the function in conjunction with the safety objectives 
that are to be attained. It is immaterial when the infor -
mation for use of the SRP/CS passes review, including 
with regard to the following points: description of the 
intended use; statement of information on the PL and 
the Category (including dated reference to the stan -
dard); explanation of all operating modes; description 
of the safeguards and safety functions with response 
times, environmental conditions for operation and 
external interfaces; information and technical data on 
transport, safe erection, commissioning and mainte -
nance. Here too, the result of the review shall be recor -
ded in writing.
•	Validation of the combination and integration of SRP/CS
The safety function described is implemented by an 
SRP/CS. Since the different technologies, electronic and 
hydraulic, are however combined within this SRP/CS, 
certain tests that are necessary when SRP/CS are com -
bined should also be performed here, unless they have 
already been included in validation of the Category. 
These tests include comparison of the interface data 
between the technologies employed, and functional 
tests and extended functional tests.7 .8.3 Examination of whether all safety  
functions have been analysed  
(see also Block 8 in Figure 7 .1)
The V&V activities shown here for SF2 are conducted for 
all safety functions performed by the SRP/CS (SF1 to SF6). 
The additional effort is however low, since many safety 
functions employ the same hardware. The analyses and 
tests shall show that the safety functions have been 
implemented correctly. Once all safety functions have 
been analysed, evaluation according to EN ISO 13849-1

This report began by addressing the design of safe con -
trol systems in general terms. Subclauses 5.7 , 6.5 and 7 .6 
then illustrated, with reference to the example of a paper-
cutting guillotine, how the methods for the design of safe 
control systems can be implemented. The methods for 
determining the PL are described step by step here and 
in EN ISO 13849-1; some of these steps however, such as 
deriving the safety-related block diagram from the circuit 
diagram, require some practice. SISTEMA Cookbook 1 [33] 
provides guidance on deriving the safety-related block 
diagram and the SISTEMA file from the circuit diagram. 
However, owing to the variety of possible safety functions 
and their implementation, the individual steps do not 
lend themselves to generic description. For this reason, 
this chapter will now present the evaluation of numerous 
circuit examples that implement the safety functions 
in various Categories and Performance Levels and by 
means of different technologies. In the circuit examples, 
the concept of a control system generally covers only the 
safety-related parts of control systems. The examples are 
limited to essential aspects, and therefore serve primarily 
to illustrate the methodology. Importance was attached 
in their selection to a wide spectrum of technologies and 
possible applications. Readers familiar with the 1997 
report [9] on the Categories for safety-related control sys -
tems to EN 954-1 will recognize some of the examples, to 
which for example calculation of the probability of failure 
has been added. Compared to the BGIA Report 2/2008e 
[57], certain examples that are no longer up to date have 
been deleted; one new example has however also been 
added. The examples are an interpretation of the Catego -
ries, and have been compiled by the authors based upon 
many years of experience with safety-related machine 
control systems and work on national and European stan -
dards committees. The examples serve to provide desig -
ners with effective guidance for their own developments. 
Since the examples were created by different authors, 
some variation inevitably exists, for example in their 
presentation of details or in the reasoning behind certain 
numerical data. All calculations for the circuit examples 
were performed with the aid of Version 2.0 of the SISTEMA 
software application (see Annex H), the version available 
at the time of production of this report. Further circuit 
examples, including SISTEMA files, are also described in 
IFA Report 4/2018e, “Safe drive controls with frequency 
inverters” [22].The description in each example is structured as follows:
•	Safety function
•	Functional description
•	Design features
•	Remarks
•	Calculation of the probability of failure
•	More detailed references
Under “safety function”, the name of the safety function 
is stated together with the events that trigger it and the 
required safety responses.
The “functional description” describes the essential 
safety-related functions, based upon a conceptual sche -
matic diagram. The behaviour in the event of a fault is 
explained, and measures for fault detection are stated.
The particular characteristics in the design of the example 
in question, such as the application of well-tried safety 
principles and the use of well-tried components, are listed 
under the “design features”.
The circuit diagrams are conceptual schematic diagrams 
that are limited solely to presentation of the safety 
function(s) with the relevant components required for this 
particular purpose. In the interests of clarity, certain addi -
tional circuitry that is normally required has been omit -
ted, for example that for the assurance of electric shock 
protection, for control of overvoltage/undervoltage and 
overpressure or low pressure, for the detection of insula -
tion faults, short-circuits and earth faults for example on 
lines routed externally, or for assurance of the required 
resistance to electromagnetic disturbance. Circuit details 
that are not essential for determining the safety-related 
block diagram have thus been deliberately omitted. Such 
details include protective circuitry in the electrical sys -
tem, such as fuses and diodes, for example in the form of 
free-wheeling diodes. The diagrams also omit decoupling 
diodes in circuits in which sensor signals, for example, 
are read in redundantly into multiple logic units. This 
arrangement is intended to prevent an input becoming an 
output on redundant systems in the event of a fault, and 
thus influencing the second channel. These components 
are all essential in order for a control system to be imple -
mented in accordance with a Category and a Performance 
Level. In accordance with the fault lists in EN ISO 13849-2, 
issues such as the influence of conductor short circuits 
must of course also be considered in relation to the safety 
function concerned and the conditions of use. All compo -
nents used must therefore be selected with consideration 
for their suitability according to their specification. Over -
dimensioning is one of the well-tried safety principles. i\n1008 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
Further examples are listed in the technology-specific 
remarks on fluid power technology.
Design features are stated only where they are relevant to 
the safety functions described. This is generally a “safety-
related stop function, initiated by a safeguard”. Other 
safety functions, such as the “prevention of unexpected 
start-up” or a “manual reset function” and “start/restart 
function” are not considered in all examples. If manually 
operated equipment (pushbuttons) is used for the imple -
mentation of such safety functions, it must be ensured 
that where the safety function is implemented in conjunc -
tion with electronics, in particular, it must be initiated by 
the release (break operation) of a button already pressed.
Where relevant to the example concerned, particular refe -
rence is made under “Remarks” to aspects specific to a 
possible application.
Under “Calculation of the probability of failure”, a descrip -
tion is provided of calculation of the PL from the para -
meters Category, MTTFD, DCavg and CCF, based upon the 
safety-related block diagram derived from the conceptual 
schematic diagram. The Category is determined from the 
functional description and the design features.
The MTTFD values employed in the calculations are marked 
as manufacturer‘s values (“[M]” for manufacturer), typical 
values from databases (“[D]” for database), or values from 
EN ISO 13849-1 (“[S]” for standard). In accordance with 
the standard, priority should be given to manufacturers‘ 
data. For certain components, neither reliable manufactu -
rers‘ data nor database values were available at the time 
of production of the report. In this case, use was made of 
the parts count method for estimation of typical example 
values (marked “[E]” for estimated). The MTTFD values in 
this chapter should therefore be regarded in some cases 
more as estimates.
The presentation of the assumed measures for diag -
nostics ( DC) and against common cause failure (CCF) is 
limited to general information. Specific values for these 
two criteria are dependent upon the implementation, the 
application and the manufacturer. It is therefore possible 
for different DC values to be assumed for similar compo -
nents in different examples. Here too, all assumptions 
regarding DC and CCF must be reviewed in real-case 
implementations; the assumed values are not binding 
and are intended solely for the purpose of illustration.
The focus in the presentation lies more upon the Cate -
gories in the form of the “resistance to faults”, the block 
diagram and the “mathematical” methods for deter -
mining the PL. Conversely, some sub-steps, such as 
fault exclusion, basic and well-tried safety principles or 
meas  ures against systematic faults (including software) 
are mentioned only briefly. During implementation, appro priate attention must be paid to this aspect, since 
mis judgements or inadequate implementation of these 
meas  ures could lead to a deterioration in the fault tole -
rance or probability of failure. As an aid to understanding 
of the circuit examples and for their practical implementa -
tion, the reader‘s attention is therefore drawn to Chapter 7 
and Annex C, in which, for example, the basic and well-
tried safety principles are described in detail.
Finally, reference is made to “more detailed references”, 
where available.
For each form of technology, certain comments of a gene -
ral nature are made in the following technology-specific 
subclauses in order to provide a better understanding of 
the examples and for implementation of the Categories. 
Some of the circuit examples represent “control systems 
involving multiple technologies”. These “mixed” circuit 
examples are based upon the concept, enshrined in the 
standard, that a safety function is always implemented by 
“reception”, “processing” and “switching”, irrespective of 
the technology employed.
8.1 General technology-related remarks on 
the example control systems
8.1.1 Electromechanical controls
Electromechanical controls primarily employ electrome -
chanical components in the form of control devices (e.g. 
position switches, selector switches, pushbuttons) and 
switchgear (contactor relays, relays, contactors). These 
devices have defined switching positions. They do not 
generally change their switching state unless actuated 
externally or electrically. When selected properly and 
used as intended, they are largely immune to disturbance, 
such as electrical or electromagnetic interference. In this 
respect they differ, in some cases considerably, from 
electronic equipment. Their durability and failure mode 
can be influenced by suitable selection, dimensioning 
and  arrangement. The same applies to the conductors 
employed, when suitably routed within and outside the 
electrical compartments.
For the reasons stated above, the electromechanical com -
ponents generally satisfy the “basic safety principles”, 
and in many cases are also to be regarded as “well-tried 
components” for safety applications. This holds true, 
however, only when the requirements of IEC 60204-1 [25] 
for the electrical equipment of the machine/installation 
are observed. In some cases, fault exclusions are possi -
ble, for example on a control contactor with regard to pick-
up in the absence of a control voltage, or non-opening of 
a break contact with direct opening action on a switch to 
IEC 60947-5-1 [56], Annex K.\n1018 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
Detailed information on the modelling of electromechani -
cal components can be found in Annex D.
8.1.2 Fluid power controls
On fluid power installations, the area of valves, i.e. valves 
controlling hazardous movements or states, should in 
particular be considered a “safety-related part of the 
control system”. The fluid power circuits listed below 
constitute example arrangements only. As a rule, the 
required safety functions can also be implemented by 
means of alternative control logic employing appropriate 
valve types, or for that matter in some cases by additional 
mechanical solutions such as hold devices or brakes.
On hydraulic systems (see Figure 8.1), measures for pres -
sure limitation in the system (1V2) and for filtration of the 
hydraulic fluid (1Z2) must also be considered in this con -
text. The components 1Z1, 1S1 and 1S2 shown in Figure 8.1 
are present in the majority of hydraulic systems and are 
of great importance, particularly for the condition of the 
hydraulic fluid and consequently for the valve functions. 
The reservoir breather filter 1Z1 arranged on the fluid 
reservoir prevents the ingress of external dirt. The fluid 
level indicator 1S2 ensures that the fluid level remains 
within the specified limits. The temperature indicator 1S1 
constitutes suitable measures for limitation of the opera -ting temperature range and thus the operating viscosity 
range of the hydraulic fluid. If necessary, heating and/or 
cooling equipment must be provided in conjunction with 
closed-loop temperature control (refer also to Annex C in 
this context).
The drive elements and the components for energy con -
versions and transmission in fluid power systems gene -
rally lie outside the scope of the standard.
On pneumatic systems (see Figure 8.2, Page 102), the 
components for the prevention of hazards associated 
with energy conversion and the maintenance unit for 
compressed air conditioning must be considered from a 
safety perspective in conjunction with the valve area. In 
order for the possible energy conversions to be controlled 
with consideration for safety aspects, an exhaust valve is 
frequently used in conjunction with a pressure switch. In 
the circuit examples in this chapter, these components 
are marked 0V1 (exhaust valve) and 0S1 (pressure switch). 
The maintenance unit 0Z (see Figure 8.2) generally con -
sists of a manual shut-off valve 0V10, a filter with water 
separator 0Z10 with monitoring of the contamination of 
the filter, and a pressure control valve 0V11 (with ade-
quately dimensioned secondary venting). The pressure 
indicator 0Z11 satisfies the requirement for monitoring of 
the system parameters.

Besides the safety-related part of the control system, 
the fluid power circuits presented as examples in this 
chapter contain only the additional components that are 
required for an understanding of the fluid power system 
or are directly related to the control technology. The 
re quirements that must be met by fluid power systems are 
described in full in [58; 59]. [60 to 63] are further relevant 
standards.
The majority of control system examples are electrohy -
draulic or electropneumatic controls. A range of safety 
requirements on these control systems are satisfied by 
the electrical part of the control system, for example the 
requirement for energy changes on electrohydraulic con -
trol systems to be controlled.
On the control examples described here, the required 
safety function is the stopping of a hazardous movement 
or the reversal of a direction of movement. Prevention of 
unexpected start-up is implicitly included. The required safety function may however also be a defined pressure 
level or a pressure release, for example.
The structures of most fluid power control systems are 
engineered in Categories 1, 3 or 4. Since Category B 
already requires observance of the relevant standards and 
of the basic safety principles, Category B and 1 fluid power 
control systems do not differ essentially in their control 
structure, but only in the higher safety-related reliability 
of the relevant valves. For this reason, this report does 
not present any Category B fluid power control systems.
Further information on hydraulics and pneumatics can be 
found on the IFA website (www.dguv.de/ifa, Webcode: 
d1029520).
8.1.3  Electronic and programmable electronic 
control systems
Electronic components are generally more sensitive to 
external environmental influences than electromechanical \n1038 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
components. If no particular measures are taken, the use 
of electronic components at temperatures below 0°C is 
subject to substantially greater constraints compared to 
electromechanical components. In addition, environmen -
tal influences exist that are virtually irrelevant to electro -
mechanical circuit elements but that present crucial prob -
lems for electronic systems, namely any electromagnetic 
disturbances that are coupled into electronic systems in 
the form of conducted disturbance or electromagnetic 
fields. In some cases, greater effort is required in order 
for adequate resistance to disturbance to be attained for 
industrial use. Fault exclusion is virtually impossible on 
electronic components. In consequence, safety cannot 
in principle be guaranteed by the design of a particular 
component, but only by certain circuit concepts and by 
the application of appropriate measures for the control of 
faults.
According to the fault lists for electrical/electronic compo -
nents to EN ISO 13849-2, the faults of short circuit, open 
circuit, change of a parameter or a value, and stuck-at 
faults are essentially assumed. These are without excep -
tion fault effects that are assumed to be permanent. Tran -
sient (sporadically occurring) faults such as soft errors 
caused by charge reversal of a capacitor in a chip owing 
to high-energy particles such as alpha particles can gene -
rally be detected only with difficulty and controlled for the 
most part by structural measures.
The failure mode of electronic components is frequently 
difficult to evaluate; generally, no predominant failure 
mode can be defined. This can be illustrated by an 
example: if a relay or contactor is not actuated electrically, 
i.e. current does not flow through its coil, there is no rea -
son for the contacts to close when the component is used 
within the constraints of its specification. In other words, 
a de-energized relay or contactor does not switch on of its 
own accord in response to an internal fault. The situation 
is different for the majority of electronic components, 
such as transistors. Even if a transistor is blocked, i.e. in 
the absence of a sufficiently high base current, the possi -
bility still cannot be excluded of it suddenly becoming 
conductive without external influence as a result of an 
internal fault, and consequently under certain circumstan -
ces initiating a hazardous movement. This drawback, 
from a safety perspective, of electronic components must 
also be controlled by a suitable circuit concept. Where 
highly integrated modules are used, in particular, it may 
not be possible to demonstrate that a device or item of 
equipment is completely free of faults even at the begin -
ning of its mission time, i.e. at commissioning. Even at 
component level, manufacturers are no longer able to 
demonstrate freedom from faults with 100% test coverage 
for complex integrated circuits. A similar situation exists 
for the software of programmable electronics.In contrast to electromechanical circuits, purely electronic 
circuits often have the advantage that a change of state 
can be forced dynamically. This permits attainment of the 
required DC at appropriately short intervals and without 
alteration of the state of external signals (forced dyna -
mics).
Decoupling measures are required between different 
channels in order to prevent common cause failures. 
These measures generally consist of galvanically isolated 
contacts, resistor or diode networks, filter circuits, opto -
couplers and transformers.
Systematic failures may lead to simultaneous failure of 
redundant processing channels if this is not prevented by 
timely consideration, in particular during the design and 
integration phase. The use of principles such as closed-
circuit current, diversity or overdimensioning enables 
electronic circuits to be designed to be robust. Measures 
that render the processing channels insensitive to the 
physical influences encountered for example in an indus -
trial environment should not be ignored. Such influences 
include temperature, moisture, dust, vibration, shock, 
corrosive atmospheres, electromagnetic influences, vol -
tage breakdown, overvoltage and undervoltage. 
A Category 1 SRP/CS must be designed and manufac -
tured with the use of well-tried components and well-tried 
safety principles. Since complex electronic components 
such as PLCs, microprocessors or ASICS are not deemed 
well-tried in the sense of the standard, this report con -
tains no corresponding examples of Category 1 electro -
nics.
The circuit examples include a statement of the effec -
tiveness, i.e. the associated Performance Level, of the 
required measures for fault avoidance/fault control for 
the programmable electronics. Further details can be 
found in subclause 6.3. Should ASICs be employed in a 
development, measures for fault avoidance are required 
in the development process. Such measures can be found 
for example in IEC 61508-2 [48], which specifies a V model 
for the development of an ASIC, based upon the V model 
familiar from software development.
The following points are worthy of mention, since such 
issues arise in practice:
•	Generally, two channels of an SRP/CS must not be rou -
ted through the same integrated circuit. For optocoup -
lers, this requirement means for example that they must 
be housed in separate enclosures when they are used 
to process signals from different channels.
•	The influence of operating systems etc. must also 
be considered where programmable electronics are 
employed. A standard PC and typical commercial ope -\n1048 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
rating system is not suitable for use in a safety-related 
control system. The required freedom from faults (or 
realistically, low incidence of faults) cannot generally 
be demonstrated with reasonable effort, or will not 
be attainable, on an operating system that was not 
de signed for safety-related applications.8.2  Circuit examples

Safety function
•	Safety-related stop function, initiated by a safeguard: actuation of the proximity switch when the movable guard 
(safety guard) is opened initiates the safety function STO (safe torque off).
Functional description
•	Opening of the movable guard (e.g. safety guard) is detected by a proximity switch B1 that acts upon the 
 undervoltage release of a motor starter Q1. The dropping out of Q1 interrupts or prevents hazardous movements 
or states.
•	The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and is dependent upon the reliability of the 
components.
•	Removal of the protective device is detected.
•	B1 contains no internal monitoring measures. No further measures for fault detection are implemented.
Design features
•	 Basic safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits (such as con -
tact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The closed-circuit current 
principle of the undervoltage release is employed as the basic safety principle.
•	A stable arrangement of the safeguard (safety screen) is assured for actuation of the proximity switch.
•	Depending upon the design of the proximity switch, bypassing of safe operation may be possible in a reasonably 
foreseeable manner. Bypassing can be made more difficult, for example by particular conditions for installation, 
such as shrouded installation (see also EN ISO 14119).
•	The power supply to the entire machine is switched off (stop Category 0 to IEC 60204-1).  \n1078 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
Q1
B1
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	MTTFD: B1 is a conventional proximity switch on a safety screen with an MTTFD of 1,100 years [M]. For the under -
voltage release of the motor starter Q1, the B10 value approximates to the electrical durability of 10,000 switching 
cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B10D value is produced by doubling of the 
B10 value. Assuming actuation once daily of the proximity switch, an nop of 365 cycles per year for Q1 produces 
an MTTFD of 548 years. For the combination of B1 and Q1, the MTTFD for each channel is 365 years. This value is 
 capped to the arithmetical maximum value for Category B, i.e. 27 years (“medium”).
•	DCavg and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category B.
•	The electromechanical control system satisfies Category B with a medium MTTFD (27 years). This results in an 
 average probability of dangerous failure of 4.2 · 10–6 per hour. This satisfies PL b.

Safety functions
•	Safety-related stop function: stopping of the hazardous movement and prevention of unexpected start-up from the

•	Only the pneumatic part of the control system is shown here, in the form of a subsystem. Further safety-related 
parts of control systems (e.g. safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems 
for completion of the safety function.
Functional description
•	Hazardous movements are controlled by a directional control valve 1V1 that is well-tried for safety applications.
•	Failure of the directional control valve may result in loss of the safety function. The failure is dependent upon the 
reliability of the directional control valve.
•	No measures for fault detection are implemented.
•	Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required.
Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met.  \n1098 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
1V1
•	1V1 is a directional control valve with closed centre position, sufficient overlap, spring-centred central position and 
fatigue-resistant springs.
•	The safety-oriented switching position is attained by cancellation of the control signal.
•	The manufacturer/user must confirm that the directional control valve is a component that is well-tried for safety 
applications (of sufficiently high reliability).
•	The safety function can also be attained by a logical arrangement of suitable valves.
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	MTTFD: a B10D value of 20,000,000 switching cycles [S] is assumed for the directional control valve 1V1. At 240 
 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 10 seconds, nop is 1,382,400 cycles per year and the MTTFD is 
145 years. This is also the MTTFD value per channel, which is capped to 100 years (“high”).
•	DCavg and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1.

Safety function
•	Actuation of the Off pushbutton leads to SS1-t (safe stop 1, time controlled), a controlled stopping of the motor 
within a maximum permissible time.
Functional description
•	Stopping of the motor is initiated by actuation of the Off button S1. The motor contactor Q1 drops out and the bra -
king function is initiated. The motor is braked by a direct current, which is generated in the braking device K1 by a 
phase-angle control with thyristors, generating a braking torque in the motor winding.
•	The stopping time must not exceed a maximum value (e.g. 10 seconds). The level of braking current required for 
this purpose can be set by means of a potentiometer on the braking device.
•	After expiration of the maximum braking time, the thyristor is no longer activated and the current path for the 
 braking current is interrupted. The stopping process corresponds to a stop of Category 1 in accordance with 
IEC 60204-1.
•	The safety function cannot be maintained with all component failures, and dependents upon the reliability of the

Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
(such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. The de-energi -
zation principle (closed current principle) is applied as a basic safety principle. For protection against unexpected 
start-up after restoration of the power supply, the control system is provided with a latching.
•	S1 is a pushbutton with direct opening action to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. S1 is therefore considered as a well-tried 
component.
•	Contactor Q1 is a well-tried component in consideration of the additional conditions in accordance with Table D.3 
of EN ISO 13849-2.
•	The braking device K1 is constructed entirely from simple electronic components such as transistors, capacitors, 
diodes resistors and thyristors. The safety-related behaviour is determined by the selection of the components. 
Internal measures for fault detection are not implemented. 
Application
•	On woodworking machines or comparable machines on which unbraked stopping would result in an impermissibly 
long run-down of the hazardous tool movements. The control of the braking function on woodworking machines 
must be designed such that at least PL b is achieved (prEN ISO 19085-1:2014).  
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	The pushbutton S1 and the contactor Q1 are combined for the calculation in SISTEMA to a subsystem that meets 
the requirements of Category 1. The braking device K1 forms a separate subsystem in Category B.
•	S1 is a pushbutton with direct opening action according to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K. 
•	MTTFD: A B10D value of 20 · 106 switching cycles [M] is specified for the pushbutton S1. B10D value of 1,300,000 swit -
ching cycles [S] at nominal load is assumed for the contactor Q1. At 300 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle 
time of 2 minutes, nop  is 72,000 cycles per year. The MTTFD is 2,777 years for the pushbutton S1 and 180 years for 
Q1. Together, this results to an MTTFD of 169 years, which in accordance with the standard is reduced to 100 years 
(“high”) for the subsystem. The contactor Q1 has a limited operation time (T10D) of 18 years. Its replacement in good 
time is recommended. The MTTFD for the braking device K1 was determined using the parts count method. The com -
ponent information from the parts list and the values from the SN 29500 database [48] yield an MTTFD of 518 years 
[D]. This is also reduced to 100 years (“high”).
•	DCavg and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category B and Category 1.
•	The subsystem S1/Q1 satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTFD (100 years). This results in an average probability of 
dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c.
•	The subsystem K1 satisfies Category B with a high MTTFD (100 years). This results in an average probability of  
dangerous failure of 4.2 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL b.
•	For the safety-related stop function, the resulting average probability of dangerous failure is 5.4 · 10-6 per hour.  
This satisfies PL b.  \n1148 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Functional description
•	Opening of the movable guard (e.g. safety guard) is detected by a position switch B1 with direct opening contact, 
which actuates a contactor Q1. The dropping out of Q1 interrupts or prevents hazardous movements or states.

current principle is employed as a basic safety principle. Earthing of the control circuit is regarded as a well-tried 
safety principle.
•	Switch B1 is a position switch with direct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K and is there -
fore regarded as a well-tried component. The break contact interrupts the circuit directly mechanically when the 
safeguard is not in the safe position.

•	A position switch is employed for position monitoring. A stable arrangement of the safeguard is assured for actua -
tion of the position switch. The actuating elements of the position switch are protected against displacement. Only 
rigid mechanical parts are employed (no spring elements acting in the direction of the actuating force).
•	The actuating stroke for the position switch complies with the manufacturer‘s specification.
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	MTTFD: an MTTFD of 20 · 106 switching cycles [M] is stated for B1. At 365 working days, 16 working hours per day and 
a cycle time of 10 minutes, the nop for these components is 35,040 cycles per year, and the MTTFD is 5,707 years. For 
the contactor Q1, the B10 value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,300,000 swit -
ching cycles [M]. If 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B10D value is produced by doubling of the B10 
value. The above assumed value for nop results in an MTTFD of 742 years for Q1. The combination of B1 and Q1 results 
in an MTTFD of 656 years for each channel. This value is capped to 100 years (“high”).
•	DCavg and measures against common cause failures are not relevant in Category 1.
•	The electromechanical control system satisfies Category 1 with a high MTTFD (100 years). This results in an average 
probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-6 per hour. This satisfies PL c. The PLr of b is therefore surpassed.

Safety function
•	Safety-related stop function, initiated by a protective device: when the light beam is interrupted, a hazardous 
movement is halted (STO – safe torque off).
Functional description
•	Interruption of a light beam of the n cascaded light barriers F1 to Fn triggers a de-energization command both by 
relays, by de-energization of the contactor relay K2, and via the PLC output (O1.1) of the test channel. The hazardous 
movement is then halted by means of the main contactor relay Q1.
•	The light barriers are tested before each start of the hazardous movement following pressing of the start button S2. 
For this purpose, the PLC output O1.2 de-energizes the light barrier transmitter in response to a software command. 
The reaction of the receiver (K2 drops out again) is monitored on the PLC inputs I1.1 and I1.2. Provided the behavi -
our is free of faults, K2 locks in via O1.2, and the hazardous movement can be initiated by the releasing of S2. K1 is 
de-energized via O1.0, and the main contactor relay Q1 actuated via O1.1.
•	Should a fault in one of the light barriers or in K2 be detected by the test, the outputs O1.1 and O1.2 are deactiva -
ted, and an actuating signal is no longer applied to the main contactor relay Q1.
•	In the event of global failure of the PLC (output O1.0 at low potential, outputs O1.1 and O1.2 at high potential), 
interruption of a light beam results in de-energization of K2, independently of the PLC. In order to ensure this inde -
pendence, the light barrier outputs are decoupled from the PLC by the decoupling diode R2. Under unfavourable 
circumstances, the light barriers can be re-activated by K2 by actuation of the start button, and the main contactor 
relay Q1 thus actuated. In this case, (only) the test equipment would have failed. Failure of the test equipment is 
detected owing to the probability of a functionally defective process under these circumstances.
•	During the test, actuation of Q1 by K1 and O1.1 is blocked.  \n1258 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
(such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented.
•	Special light barriers with suitable optical characteristics (aperture angle, extraneous light immunity, etc.) to 
IEC 61496-2 are employed.
•	Several light barriers can be cascaded and monitored by only two PLC inputs and a relay or contactor relay.
•	The contactor relays K1 and K2 possess mechanically linked contact elements in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, 
Annex L. The main contactor relay Q1 possesses a mirror contact in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F.
•	The standard components F1 to Fn and K3 are employed in accordance with the guidance in subclause 6.3.10.
•	The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (reduction of the requirements 
in the test channel owing to diversity) and the guidance in subclause 6.3.10.
•	The start button S2 must be located outside the hazard zone and at a point from which the hazard zone is visible.
•	The number, arrangement and height of the light beams must comply with EN ISO 13855 and IEC 62046.
•	Should an arrangement for the safeguarding of hazard zones permit stepping behind the sensing field, further 
measures are required, such as a restart interlock. The start button S2 can be used for this purpose. To this end, 
the PLC K3 compares the duration for which the button is pressed with maximum and minimum values. Only if the 
conditions are met is a start command deemed valid. 
Remarks
•	The example is intended for use in applications with an infrequent demand of the safety function. This enables the 
requirement for the designated architecture for Category 2 to be satisfied, i.e. “testing much more frequent than 
the demand of the safety function” (cf. Annex G).
•	Following triggering of a stop, the light barriers remain deactivated until the next start. This enables a hazard zone 
for example to be entered without this being “registered” by the circuit. The behaviour can be modified by corres -
ponding adaptation of the circuit.  
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	By way of example, three light barriers F1 to F3 are considered for calculation of the probability of failure. Safeguar -
ding of a second hazard zone constitutes a further safety function for which calculation is performed separately.
•	For calculation of the probability of failure, the overall system is divided into two subsystems, “light barriers” and 
“main contactor relay” (Q1).
For the “light barriers” subsystem:
•	F1, F2, F3 and K2 constitute the functional path of the Category 2 circuit structure; the PLC K3 (including decoupling 
diode R2) constitutes the test equipment. S2 and K1 have the function of activating testing of the light barrier, and 
are not involved in the calculation of the probability of failure.
•	MTTFD: an MTTFD of 100 years [E] is assumed for each of F1 to F3. The B10D value for K2 is 20,000,000 cycles [S]. 
At 240 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 180 seconds, nop is 76,800 cycles per year. Testing as 
described above doubles this value, to an nop of 153,600 cycles per year with an MTTFD of 1,302 years for K2.  \n1268 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
These values yield an MTTFD of 32 years (“high”) for the functional channel. An MTTFD of 50 years [E] is assumed for 
K3. Compared to this value, the MTTFD value of 228,311 years [S] for the decoupling diode R2 is irrelevant.
•	DCavg: the reasoning for the DC of 60% for F1 to F3 is the functional test as described. The DC of 99% for K2 is 
derived from direct monitoring in K3 with the aid of mechanically linked contact elements. The averaging formula 
returns a result of 61% (“low”) for DCavg.
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec -
tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	The combination of the control elements in the “light barriers” subsystem satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTFD 
of the functional channel (32 years) and low DCavg (61%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure 
PFHD of 1.9 · 10-6 per hour.
The following assumptions are made for the “main contactor relay” subsystem:
•	B10D = 1,300,000 cycles [S] with an nop of 76,800 cycles per year. This leads to an MTTFD of 169 years, which in 
accordance with the standard is capped to 100 years. The structure satisfies Category 1; DCavg and common cause 
failures are not therefore relevant. The resulting average probability of dangerous failure is 1.1 · 10-6 per hour.
•	Addition of the average probabilities of dangerous failure of the two subsystems results in a PFHD of 3.0 · 10-6 per 
hour. This satisfies PL c.
•	If it is anticipated that a demand will be made upon the safety function more frequently than assumed for the Cate -
gory 2 designated architecture (the ratio is lower than 100:1, i.e. more frequently than once every 5 hours), this can 
be allowed for accordance with Annex K, Note 1 of the standard by an additional penalty of 10% down to a ratio of 
25:1. In the case with three light barriers under consideration here, the “light barriers” subsystem still attains a 
PFHD of 2.1 · 10-6 per hour. The average probability of dangerous failure PFHD of 3.2 · 10-6 per hour only attains PL b, 
however. For PL c to be attained, the number of light barriers would for example have to be reduced, or compo -
nents with a higher MTTFD employed.
•	In consideration of the estimation erring on the safe side as described above, an operation time (T10D) of 17 years is 
produced for specified replacement of the wearing component Q1.

Safety function
•	Actuation of the emergency-stop device S3 causes the drive to be stopped in a controlled manner (SS1-t – safe 
stop 1 with STO following expiry of a deceleration time).
Functional description
•	The hazardous movement is stopped if either the stop button S1 or one of the emergency stop devices S3 or S4 
is actuated. Only actuation by means of the emergency-stop device S3 is considered in this example. The drive is 
halted in an emergency in response to actuation of S3: first by deactivation of the emergency stop safety module 
K4, accompanied by shut-off of the contactor relays K1 and K2. Opening of the make contact K1 on the input I4 of 
the PLC K5 causes the starting signal on the frequency inverter (FI) T1 to be cancelled via the PLC output O2. Redun -
dantly to the K1-K5-T1 chain, opening of the make contact K2 upstream of the contactor relay with drop-out delay K3  i\n1298 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

initiates a braking timer; upon timeout of the braking timer, the actuating signal for the mains contactor Q1 is inter -
rupted. The timer setting is selected such that under unfavourable operating conditions, the machine movement is 
halted before the mains contactor Q1 has dropped out.
•	Functional stopping of the drive following a stop command is initiated by opening of the two break contacts of the 
stop button S1. As with stopping in an emergency, the status is first queried by the PLC K5 via the input I0, and the 
FI is shut down by resetting of the PLC output O2. Redundantly to this process, the contactor relay K3 is shut-off 
– with drop-out delay provided by the capacitor C1 – and following timeout of the set braking time, the activation 
signal to the mains contactor Q1 is interrupted.
•	In the event of failure of the PLC K5, the frequency inverter T1, the mains contactor Q1, the contactor relays K1/
K2 or the contactor relay with drop-out delay K3, stopping of the drive is nevertheless assured, since two shut-off 
paths independent of each other are always present. Failure of the contactor relays K1 and K2 to drop out is detec -
ted – at the latest following resetting of the actuated emergency stop device – by monitoring of the mechanically 
linked break contacts within the emergency stop safety module K4. Failure of the contactor relay K3 to drop out is 
detected – at the latest before renewed start-up of the machine movement – through feedback of the mechanically 
linked break contact to the PLC input I3. Failure of the mains contactor Q1 to drop out is detected by the mirror con -
tact read in on the PLC input I3. Welding of this mirror contact is detected by the mechanically linked auxiliary make 
contact on the PLC input I2. In the event of a fault in the capacitor C1, the measured drop-out time of the contactor 
relay K3 differs from the time specified in the PLC. The fault is detected and leads to the machine being shut down 
and to operating inhibition of the machine. Organizational measures ensure that each emergency-stop device is 
actuated at least once a year.
Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
(such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented.
•	The contactor relays K1, K2 and K3 possess mechanically linked contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, 
Annex L.
•	The pushbuttons S1, S3 and S4 possess direct opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K.
•	The contactor Q1 possesses a mirror contact in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F.
•	The standard components K5 and T1 are employed in accordance with the guidance in subclause 6.3.10.
•	The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (downgraded owing to 
 diversity) and the guidance in subclause 6.3.10.
•	Delayed attainment of standstill by the second shut-off path alone in the event of a fault must not involve an 
un acceptably high residual risk.
•	The SRP/CS of the emergency stop safety module K4 satisfies all requirements for Category 3 and PL d.  
Calculation of the probability of failure
Only the probability of failure of the emergency stop function is calculated.
•	The emergency-stop device S3 is equipped with two break contacts S3.1 and S3.2. The manufacturer states a B10D of 
127 ,500 cycles for each of the blocks S3.1 and S3.2. With actuation annually and a resulting nop  of 1 cycle per year, 
the MTTFD of each contact is 1,275,000 years. The emergency stop safety module K4 is a tested safety component. 
Its probability of failure is 3.0 · 10-7 per hour [M], and is added at the end of the calculation.  \n1308 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
The following applies for the probability of failure of the downstream two-channel structure:
•	MTTFD: the PLC K5 has an MTTFD of ten years [S]. The frequency inverter has an MTTFD of 35 years [M]. The capacitor 
C1 is included in the calculation with an MTTFD of 45,662 years [D]. At a B10D value of 5,000,000 cycles [M] and a rate 
of operations of daily energization on 240 working days, the result is an MTTFD of 208,333 years for K1 and K2. At a 
B10D value of 2,000,000 cycles [M] and at 240 working days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 3 minutes, the nop 
is 76,800 cycles per year and the MTTFD 260 years for K3. At a B10D value of 600,000 cycles [M] and at 240 working 
days, 16 working hours and a cycle time of 3 minutes, the nop is 76,800 cycles per year and the MTTFD 7 .8 years for 
Q1. These values produce a symmetrized  MTTFD for the channel of 60 years (“high”).
•	DCavg: an adequate test rate of the emergency-stop devices is assured (refer to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 
and D.2.5.1). Fault detection of the blocks S3.1 and S3.2 is achieved by cross monitoring in K4 ( DC = 90%). Fault 
detection by the process in the event of failure of actuation of the deceleration ramp leads to a DC of 60% for K5. 
For T1, the DC is 60%, likewise as a result of fault detection by the process. K1 and K2 exhibit a DC of 99% owing to 
the integral fault detection in K4. For K3, the DC is 99% owing to fault detection by K5. For C1, the DC is 60% owing 
to testing in the PLC of the timing element with the FI shut-off by way of the drop-out time of the contactor relay K3. 
For Q1, the DC is then 99% owing to direct monitoring in K5. The averaging formula for the DCavg yields a result of 
64% (“low”).
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (75 points): separation (15), diversity (20), FMEA (5) and envi -
ronmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	The two-channel combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3. This yields an average probability of 
dangerous failure PFHD of 3.9 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. Addition of the probability of dangerous failure of 
K4 and S3 yields an overall probability of failure of 7 .4 · 10-7 per hour. This also then satisfies PL d.
•	The wearing contactor Q1 should be replaced after approximately 7 .8 years (T10D).

Functional description
•	Hazardous movements are controlled by a directional control valve 1V1.
•	Failure of the directional control valve 1V1 between functional tests may result in loss of the safety function. The 
failure is dependent upon the reliability of the directional control valve.
•	Testing of the safety function is forced via the PLC K1 by means of a displacement measurement system 1S1. Testing 
takes place at suitable intervals and in response to a demand of the safety function. Detection of failure of 1V1 
leads to the exhaust valve 0V1 being switched off.
•	Interruption of the hazardous movement by means of the exhaust valve 0V1 generally results in a longer overrun. 
The distance from the hazard zone must be selected in consideration of the longer overrun.
•	The test function must not be impaired by failure of the directional control valve. Failure of the test function must 
not lead to failure of the directional control valve.
•	Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required.
Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met.
•	1V1 is a directional control valve with closed centre position, sufficient overlap and spring-centred central position.
•	The safety-oriented switching position is attained by cancellation of the control signal.
•	Testing may for example take the form of checking of the time/distance characteristic (displacement measurement 
system 1S1) of the hazardous movements in conjunction with the switching position of the directional control 
valve, with evaluation in a PLC (K1).
•	K1 must not be used for the electrical drive of 1V1.
•	In order to prevent a systematic failure, the higher-level de-energization function (acting upon exhaust valve 0V1 in 
this example) is checked at suitable intervals, e.g. daily.
•	For use in applications with infrequent operator intervention in the hazard zone. This enables the requirement of 
the designated architecture for Category 2 to be satisfied. The requirement is for testing to be performed immedia -
tely when a demand is made upon the safety function, and for the total time for detection of the failure and placing 
of the machine in a non-hazardous state, for example in consideration of the overrun, which depends upon factors 
including the depressurization and switching times of the valves (depressurization in this case is at a higher level 
via the valve 0V1), to be shorter than the time to attainment of the hazard (see also EN ISO 13855 and cf. sub -
clause 6.2.14).
•	The standard component K1 is employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10.
•	The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL b (downgraded owing to diver -
sity) and the information in subclause 6.3.  \n1348 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	MTTFD of the functional channel: a B10D value of 20,000,000 switching cycles [S] is assumed for the directional con -
trol valve 1V1. At 240 working days, 16 working hours per day and a cycle time of 5 seconds, nop is 2,764,800 swit -
ching cycles per year and the MTTFD is 72.3 years. This is also the MTTFD value for the functional channel.
•	MTTFD of the test channel: an MTTFD value of 150 years [E] is assumed for the displacement measurement system 
1S1. An MTTFD value of 50 years [E] is assumed for the PLC K1. A B10D value of 20,000,000 cycles [S] applies for the 
exhaust valve 0V1. At actuation once daily on 240 working days, the MTTFD value for 0V1 is 833,333 years. The 
MTTFD of the test channel is thus 37 .5 years.
•	DCavg: the DC of 60% for 1V1 is based upon comparison of the distance/time characteristic of the hazardous move -
ment in conjunction with the switching status of the directional control valve. This is also the DCavg (“low”).
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec -
tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	The combination of the pneumatic control elements satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTFD (72.3 years) and low 
DCavg (60%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 7 .6 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d. 
The addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function may under certain 
circumstances result in a lower PL. The wearing element 1V1 should be replaced approximately every seven years 
(T10D).

Safety function
•	No-load/slack-cable detection: should a slack cable or suspension element be detected on a studio hoist, the 
downward movement is stopped (STO – safe torque off).
Functional description
•	Studio hoists driven by electric motors are widely used in studio and stage applications. During downward move -
ment, the cable may become slack should the load stick or tilt or come to rest on other objects. In such cases, a 
risk exists for example of the obstruction suddenly giving way, the load slipping, and danger consequently arising 
for persons in the hazard zone.
•	Upward and downward movements of the studio hoist can for example be controlled by means of an infrared 
remote control. This function is not evaluated here; it must, however, always be implemented with consideration 
for safety.
•	In order for the studio hoist to be prevented from falling in the event of breakage of one suspension element, the 
load is borne by two suspension elements. A slack-cable switch B1/B2 with a break-contact element/make-contact 
element combination is fitted to each suspension element.
•	The microcontroller K1 evaluates the switching states of the slack-cable switches B1 and B2. Via logic gates K2/K3 
and optocoupled transistor amplifiers K16/K17 , K1 also controls the contactor relays K19 and K20 for the upward 
and downward movements of the studio hoist.
•	The switching states of the contacts of the slack-cable switches B1 and B2 are evaluated by the microcontroller 
K1 and tested for plausibility. For testing of the inputs used on the microcontroller, forced dynamics is employed 
on the signals from the slack-cable switch B1. This involves the microcontroller forcing a temporary signal change 
via the logic gates K5 and K6, in order to ascertain whether the inputs are still able to transmit the signal change. 
Forced dynamics of the signals of one slack-cable switch is sufficient.  \n1418 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

•	Self-tests of the integrated units such as the ALU, RAM and ROM are performed in the microcontroller K1. The vol -
tage monitor K7 monitors the supply voltage generated by means of K22. Faults in the microcontroller are detected 
by temporal monitoring of the program sequence in the watchdog K8. The components K19 to K21 for control of 
the studio hoist‘s upward and and downward movements are monitored by means of readback – decoupled by 
optocouplers K13 to K15 – in the microcontroller. Should a fault be detected, the studio hoist is shut off at a higher 
level by the component detecting the fault via the contactor relay K21, actuated by logic gate K4 and decoupled by 
optocoupler K18. If the watchdog K8 is not retriggered in time by the microcontroller K1, the movement of the studio 
hoist is stopped from K8 via all logic gates K2 to K4.
Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented.
•	A slack cable is detected redundantly for both suspension elements via the two slack-cable switches B1 and B2. 
These switches contain position switches with direct opening action in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K.
•	A stable arrangement is assured for the operating mechanism of the slack-cable switches.
•	K19 to K21 possess mechanically linked contact elements to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex L.
•	The software (SRESW) for K1 is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL d and the information in 
subclause 6.3.  
Remarks
•	DIN 56950-2, subclause 5.2.1 requires two suspension elements in order to prevent a studio hoist and its load from 
falling.
•	Visual inspections and maintenance of the suspension elements must be performed at suitable intervals.
•	Parts of the circuit structure as shown are not explicitly designed to prevent possible hazards resulting from 
un expected movement of the studio hoist.
•	As the calculation of the probability of failure shows, the circuit structure used attains PL d for the safety function 
under consideration here. Use of the risk graph to determine the required Performance Level PLr with the para-
meters S2, F1 and P1 in accordance with DIN 56950-2, subclause A.1.2.3.3 results in a PLr of c, provided the stu -
dio hoist is operated under supervision and only by skilled personnel.  Should this not be the case, a PLr of d is 
 required.
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	Components are grouped into blocks in Figure 8.25 in the interests of clarity. K9 to K15 each contain one optocoup -
ler and two resistances. K16 to K18 additionally each contain a transistor for driving the downstream contactor 
relays.
•	For application of the simplified procedure for estimation of the achieved PL, the components in the circuit are 
assigned to the blocks of the designated architecture for Category 2 as follows:  
I: B1  
L: K10, K6, K1, K2, K16, K3, K17 , K22  
O: K19, K20  
TE: B2, K11, K12, K9, K5, K7 , K8, K4, K18, K13, K14, K15  
OTE: K21\n1428 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	MTTFD: the MTTFD values required for the calculation were sourced primarily from EN ISO 13849-1 [S], and from 
SN 29500-2 and SN 29500-14 [D]. The following values are substituted for B1 and B2: B10D: 100,000 cycles [E]; 
nop: 10 cycles per year. For the contactor relays K19 to K21: B10D: 400,000 cycles [S]; nop: 10 cycles per day on 
365 working days. An MTTFD of 1,141 years [D] is substituted for the microcontroller K1. The following MTTFD values 
are sub  stituted for the electronic components [D]: 4,566 years for the watchdog K8, 5,707 years for the optocoup -
lers K9 to K18, 22,831 years for the logic gates K2 to K6, 38,052 years for the voltage monitor K7 , 45,662 years for 
transistors and 228,310 years for resistors. An MTTFD of 228 years [E] is assumed for the power supply K22. Summa -
tion of the failure rates for all components of the functional channel (blocks I, L and O) produces an MTTFD value of 
128 years. This value is capped to 100 years (“high”) in accordance with the requirements of the standard.
•	The MTTFD of the test channel is produced by summation of the failure rates of all components of blocks TE and 
OTE. The resulting value of 389 years is greater than or equal to half of the MTTFD of the functional channel.
•	DCavg: the DC is 60% for B1, K10 and K6 owing to cross monitoring of B1 and B2 in K1 with a low demand rate upon 
the safety function. The DC is 60% for K1 owing to temporal monitoring of program sequence and self-tests of sim -
ple effectiveness. The DC is 99% for K2, K3, K16, K17 , K19 and K20 owing to direct monitoring by means of mecha -
nically linked contact elements. For K22, the DC is 99%. The averaging formula returns a result of 93% (“medium”) 
for DCavg.
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection (15) and 
environmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTFD of the functional channel 
(100 years) and medium DCavg (93%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure PFHD of  
2.3 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d.

Safety functions
•	Safety-related stop function: stopping of the hazardous movement and prevention of unexpected start-up from the 
rest position, implemented by safety sub-functions SSC and SBC
•	Only the pneumatic part of the control system is shown here, in the form of a subsystem. Further SRP/CS (e.g. 
safeguards and electrical logic elements) must be added in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety 
function.
Functional description
•	Hazardous movements are controlled/stopped redundantly by a directional control valve 1V1 and a brake 2Z1 on 
the piston rod respectively. The brake 2Z1 is actuated by a control valve 2V1.
•	Failure of one of these valves or of the brake alone does not result in loss of the safety function.
•	The directional control valve and the brake are actuated cyclically in the process.  \n1458 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

2S1
•	The functioning of the control valve 2V1 is monitored by means of a pressure switch 2S1. Certain faults on the 
unmonitored directional control valve 1V1 and the unmonitored brake 2Z1 are detected in the work process. In 
addition, the overrun (distance/time characteristic) during the braking process (dynamic) and/or at start-up of the 
machine (static) is monitored with the aid of a displacement measurement system 1S1 on the piston rod. An accu -
mulation of undetected faults may lead to loss of the safety function.
•	Testing of the safety function is implemented at suitable intervals, for example at least every eight working hours.
•	The test function must not be impaired by failure of the brake. Failure of the test function must not lead to failure of 
the brake.
•	Should trapped compressed air pose a further hazard, additional measures are required.
Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met.
•	The directional control valve 1V1 features a closed centre position with sufficient overlap and spring-centred central 
position.
•	The safety-oriented switching position is assumed from any position by cancellation of the control signal.
•	Signals from the pressure monitor 2S1 and the displacement measurement system 1S1 are processed for example 
in the upstream electrical logic (not shown).  
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	MTTFD: B10D values of 20,000,000 cycles [S] are assumed for the valves 1V1 and 2V1. At 240 working days,  
16 working hours and a cycle time of 15 seconds, nop is 921,600 cycles per year. The MTTFD for 1V1 and 2V1 is thus 
217 years. A B10D value of 5,000,000 switching cycles [M] is substituted for the mechanical brake on the piston rod 
2Z1. This results in an MTTFD of 54 years for the mechanical brake. Overall, the resulting symmetrized MTTFD value 
per channel is 75 years (“high”).
•	DCavg: pressure monitoring of the control signal for the brake results in a DC of 99% for the control valve 2V1. The 
DC for the directional control valve 1V1 is 60% owing to fault detection through the process. Start-up testing of the 
mechanical brake yields a DC of 75% for 2Z1. Averaging thus produces a DCavg of 76.5% (“low”).
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec -
tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	The combination of the pneumatic control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTFD per channel (75 years) 
and low DCavg (76.5%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 1.1 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies 
PL d. The addition of further SRP/CS in the form of subsystems for completion of the safety function may under 
certain circumstances result in a lower PL.
•	The wearing brake 2Z1 should be replaced at intervals of approximately five years (T10D). \n1468 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Safety function
•	Safety-related stop function, initiated by a protective device: penetration of the laser scanner‘s detection zone 
results in stopping of the hazardous movement.
Functional description
•	The laser scanner F1 monitors, with its detection zone, the area in which movement of the cylinder 1A may present 
a danger to the operator. The output signal of the laser scanner is read in on two channels by the safety PLC K1. 
Following any violation of the detection zone, the next movement must be enabled by actuation of a start button S1 
evaluated in K1 (restart interlock). K1 controls the movement of 1A with the aid of the hydraulic part of the control 
system.
•	The hydraulic part of the control system comprises a two-channel arrangement. The first channel comprises direc -
tional control valve 1V3, which acts upon the pilot-operated non-return valve 1V4. In the closed position, 1V4 blocks 
movements of 1A. The second channel consists of the directional control valve 1V5, which in its closed centre posi -
tion also prevents movement of 1A.
•	1V5 is actuated cyclically in the process. 1V3 and 1V4 close only in the event of violation of the detection zone 
(demand of the safety function), but at least once per shift.
•	Direct position monitoring 1S3 is implemented on 1V4 and evaluated in K1 as a fault detection measure. Faults in 
1V5 can be detected via the process owing to the function. An accumulation of undetected faults in the hydraulic 
part of the control system may lead to loss of the safety function.  \n1498 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
(such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented.
•	Faults in the conductors to F1 and K1 must not be hazardous in their effects. For this purpose, faults are detected  
as they arise, and the safe state is initiated. Alternatively, fault exclusion to EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.4 must be  
possible for conductor short circuits.
•	The laser scanner F1 and safety PLC K1 are tested safety components for use in PL d that satisfy Category 3 and the 
relevant product standards.
•	The directional control valve 1V5 features a closed centre position with sufficient overlap and spring-centred central 
position. The position of 1V4 is monitored electrically, since 1V4 is not switched cyclically.
•	The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL d and the information in sub -
clause 6.3.
•	It is assumed that each output of the safety PLC is driven by both processing channels of the PLC. Should this not 
be the case, the outputs that drive 1V3 and 1V4 are driven by one channel of the PLC, the output that drives 1V5 by 
the other.  
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	Since the laser scanner F1 and the safety PLC K1 are available for purchase as safety components, their probabi -
lities of failure are added at the end of the calculation (F1: PFHD = 8.0 · 10-8 per hour [M], K1: PFHD = 2.5 · 10-9 per 
hour [M]). For the hydraulic part of the control system, the probability of failure is calculated as shown below.
•	MTTFD: values of 150 years [M] are assumed for the valves 1V3 to 1V5. Overall, this results in a symmetrized MTTFD 
value of 88 years (“high”) for the two channels.
•	DCavg: a DC of 99% for 1V4 is produced by direct monitoring in K1 with the aid of the position monitor 1S3. Owing to 
the close coupling of 1V3 and 1V4, this results in 1V3 being monitored indirectly at the same time with a DC of 99%. 
The DC of 60% for 1V5 is based upon fault detection in the process with cyclical actuation. Averaging thus produces 
a DCavg of 86% (“low”).
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (90 points): separation (15), diversity (20), FMEA (5), overvol -
tage protection etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	The combination of the control elements in the hydraulic part satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTFD per channel 
(88 years) and low DCavg (86%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 6.2 · 10-8 per hour for 
the hydraulic system.
•	Altogether, the average probability of dangerous failure PFHD is (8.0 + 0.25 + 6.2) · 10-8 per hour = 1.4 · 10-7 per hour. 
This satisfies PL d.  \n1508 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Safety functions
•	Safety-related stop function: stopping of the hazardous movement and prevention of unexpected start-up from the 
rest position of tools on earth-moving machinery.
•	Further safety-related functions, such as that for preventing an incorrect direction of movement being selected for 
tools on the earth-moving machine, are not considered in this example.
Functional description
•	The multi-purpose control (MPC) S1 converts the operator‘s manual movement of it into electronic messages. It 
sends these messages cyclically over a serial data communications line (bus system) to the logic control. This 
generates control signals for the hydraulics, which in turn executes the working movements of the earth-moving 
machine desired by the operator.
•	The message 1 sent by the MPC S1 reaches the microcontroller K3 via the bus transceiver K1. From message 1 and 
in accordance with the algorithms stored in the software, K3 generates the analog signals required for actuation of 
the proportional valve 1V4. The resistances R1/R2 and the measuring amplifiers K6/K8 have the function of cont -
rolling the output currents for the proportional valve. The microcontroller K4 receives a redundant message 2 from 
S1 via the bus transceiver K2. Within the response time/process safety time, K4 checks the correct displacement of 
the proportional valve 1V4, as signalled by the position measuring system 1S4 integrated into 1V4, for plausibility 
against the desired position determined from message 2. Should faults be detected, K4 switches off the hydraulic 
pressure at a higher level by means of the directional control valve 1V3, and places the system in the safe state.  
Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
(such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented.
•	The MPC is a safety component suitable for use in PL d and satisfies the requirements for Category 3.
•	In accordance with the functional description, processing of the control information and actuation of the valves are 
effected within a Category 2 structure. Within this structure, K4 and 1S4 form the test channel with 1V3 as the shut-
off element of the test channel.
•	Owing to the continual monitoring of 1V4 by K4 through 1S4, failure of 1V4 can be detected as soon as a demand is 
made upon the safety function. 1V3 must execute the safe response within the response time in order for the struc -
ture of the control to satisfy Category 2. Abrupt switching of 1V3 at a higher level must not give rise to hazards.
•	The proportional valve 1V4 and the directional control valve 1V3 have a closed position/closed centre position, 
spring centred central position, and sufficient overlap.
•	The software (SRESW) for K3 and K4 is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL d and the informa -
tion in subclause 6.3.  \n1548 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	Data transfer from the MPC to the logic control is safe in accordance with GS-ET-26/IEC 61784-3. The data commu -
nications protocol employed contains redundant messages with comparison between K3 and K4, and measures 
for detection of the following transmission errors: repetition, loss, insertion, incorrect sequence, corruption, delay 
and masquerade (see also subclause 6.2.18). The residual error rate Λ is lower than 1 · 10-8 per hour and thus con -
tributes, as specified in the assessment standards, less than 1% towards the maximum permissible probability of 
failure of the safety function. Modelling is in Category 4; the resulting component in the calculation of the overall 
probability of failure is negligible.
Remarks
•	An emergency motion function of the earth-moving machine, which is not shown here, may be required; if so, it 
must be implemented at a higher level.  
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	The multi-purpose control S1 is a commercial safety component. The associated probability of failure is added at 
the end of the calculation ( PFHD = 3.0 · 10-7 per hour [E]). For the remaining part of the control system, the probabi -
lity of failure is calculated below.
•	MTTFD of data communication: an MTTFD of 11,416 years [D] is assumed for the bus transceivers K1 and K2. This is 
capped in Category 4 to the maximum value of 2,500 years.
•	DCavg of data communication: DC = 99% for K1 and K2 by cross monitoring of the messages in the microcontrollers 
K3 and K4.
•	The calculated probability of failure of data communication is a PFHD of 9.1 · 10-10 per hour.
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection (15) and 
environmental conditions (25 + 10). This analysis also applies to the downstream parts of the control system.
•	MTTFD of the functional channel of the logic and hydraulic control system: in accordance with SN 29500-2, an MTTFD 
of 878 years [D] is considered for the microcontroller K3, including its peripherals. The following values are substi -
tuted for the further electrical components [D]: 45,662 years for the switching transistors K5 and K7 , 228,311 years 
for the resistances R1 and R2, and 1,142 years for the measuring amplifiers K6 and K8. An MTTFD of 150 years [S] is 
assumed for the proportional valve 1V4. The MTTFD value of the functional channel is thus 104 years.
•	MTTFD of the test channel of the logic and hydraulic control: in accordance with SN 29500-2, an MTTFD of 878 years 
[D] is considered for the microcontroller K4, including its peripherals. An MTTFD of 75 years [E] is assumed for the 
position measuring system 1S4. An MTTFD of 150 years [S] is assumed for the directional control valve 1V3. The 
MTTFD value of the test channel is thus 47 years. Use of the simplified procedure described in the standard for esti -
mation of the quantifiable aspects of the PL is conditional upon the MTTFD of the test channel being greater than 
half the MTTFD of the functional channel. The MTTFD value of the functional channel is therefore reduced to 94 years.
•	DCavg of the functional channel of the logic and hydraulic control: the DC for K3 is 60% owing to cross monitoring 
with K4 and self-tests of simple effectiveness by means of software; the DC for the remaining electrical compo -
nents is 90% owing to fault detection in K4 by means of the position measuring system 1S4. The DC for 1V4 is 99% 
owing to direct monitoring of the position via 1S4 in K4. The averaging formula for DCavg produces a result of 93% 
(“medium”).
•	The logic and hydraulic control satisfies Category 2 with a high MTTFD of each channel (94 years) and medium DCavg 
(93%). This results in an average probability of dangerous failure PFHD of 2.5 · 10-7 per hour.
•	The average probability of dangerous failure of the safety function is produced by addition of the proportions for 
the MPC, the data communication and the logic and hydraulic control, yielding a PFHD of 5.5 · 10-7 per hour. This 
satisfies PL d.  \n1558 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Safety functions
•	Safety-related stop function, initiated by a guard: opening of the moveable guard initiates the safety function STO 
(safe torque off):  
Guard 1 with type 1 position switches (loading)  
Guard 2 with type 2 position switch (unloading)
•	Emergency stop function, STO – safe torque off by actuation of the emergency stop device
Functional description
•	Actuation of the emergency stop device S1 possessing two direct opening contacts causes hazardous movements 
or states to be de-energized redundantly via the safety module K1, by interruption of the control voltage of the con -
tactor Q1 and selection of the controller inhibit of the frequency inverter T1. 
•	In addition, a hazard zone is guarded by two moveable guards (e.g. one each for loading and unloading). Opening 
of guard 1 is detected by two position switches B1/B2 employing a break contact/make contact combination, and 
evaluated in a central safety module K2. The latter can interrupt or prevent hazardous movements or states in the 
same way as K1. Guard 2 is monitored by a type 2 position switch with the contacts B3.1 and B3.2 and a safety 
module K3, also acting upon Q1 and T1.
•	The safety function is retained in the event of a component failure.
•	The majority of component failures are detected and lead to operating inhibition. The position switches B1 and B2 
on guard 1 are monitored for plausibility in the associated safety module. The safety module also employs internal 
diagnostics measures. 
•	The electrical contacts B3.1 and B3.2 are monitored for plausibility in the associated safety module K3. This also 
employs internal diagnostics measures. 
•	Faults in the contactor Q1 are detected by means of mirror contacts and their readback in K2 and K3. Additional 
readback in K1 is not necessary, since a demand for the emergency stop function is much less frequent. A part of 
the faults in T1 are detected by the process. A small number of faults are not detected by the controller.
•	Organizational measures ensure that the emergency-stop device is actuated at least once a year.  
Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
(such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented.
•	A stable arrangement of the guards is assured for actuation of the position switches.
•	The emergency stop device S1 with the direct opening contacts S1.1 and S1.2 satisfies EN ISO 13850.
•	The contacts of the position switches B2 and B3 have direct opening action in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, 
Annex K.
•	The supply conductors to the position switches B1, B2 and B3 are laid separately or with protection.
•	The contactor Q1 possesses mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F.  \n1588 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	The safety modules K1, K2 and K3 satisfy all requirements for Category 4 and PL e.
•	The frequency inverter T1 has no integral safety function.
Remarks
•	The emergency stop function is a complementary protective measure to EN ISO 12100 [3].  
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	Each of the three safety functions can be presented in three subsystems. The safety-related block diagram shows 
the safety-related stop function by way of example for one of the safeguards, since only one guard is opened at any 
given time. A comparable safety function with a virtually identical calculation of the probability of failure applies 
to the second guard. Reasoning must be provided for fault exclusion for breakage of the actuator of the position 
switch B3.  
The probability of failure of the subsystems is calculated as follows.
•	S1 is a standard emergency stop device to EN ISO 13850. A B10D value of 100,000 switching cycles for each contact 
can be substituted for emergency stop devices, irrespective of the load [S]. Three actuations per year is assumed 
for nop. In consideration of the total switching operations of Q1 caused by actuation of the safeguards, this value is 
not applied during further analysis of the two safety functions.
•	MTTFD (guard 1, loading): switch B1 is a position switch with make contact. The B10D is 1 · 105 switching cycles [M]. 
For the position switch B2 with direct opening action and roller actuation, the B10D is 20 · 106 switching cycles [M]. 
At 220 working days, 16 working hours per day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, nop  is 21,120 cycles per year for 
these components, and the MTTFD is 47 .3 years for B1 and 9,469 years for B2.  
For the contactor Q1, the B10 value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an electrical durability of 1,000,000 
switching cycles [M]. If 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B10D value is produced by doubling of the 
B10 value. Since Q1 is involved in both safety-related stop functions, double the value assumed above for nop yields 
an MTTFD of 473 years. The MTTFD for the frequency inverter T1 is 20 years [M]. Altogether, the symmetrized MTTFD 
value per channel in the subsystem Q1/T1 is 68.9 years (“high”). The position switch B1 exhibits a limited opera -
tion time of 4.7 years. Its replacement in good time is recommended.
•	MTTFD (guard 2, unloading): for the position switch B3 with separate actuator and the direct opening contacts B3.1 
and B3.2, a B10D value of 4,000,000 cycles [M] is stated for each contact. At 220 working days, 16 working hours per 
day and a cycle time of 10 minutes, nop for these components is 21,120 cycles per year, and the MTTFD 1,893 years. 
For the contactor Q1, the B10 value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to the electrical durability of 1,000,000 
switching cycles [M]. Since 50% of failures are assumed to be dangerous, the B10D value is produced by doubling of 
the B10 value. Since the contactor Q1 is involved in both safety-related stop functions (loading and unloading), dou -
bling the value assumed for nop yields an MTTFD of 473 years. The MTTFD for the frequency inverter T1 is 20 years [M]. 
Altogether, the symmetrized MTTFD value per channel in the subsystem Q1/T1 is 68 years (“high”).
•	DCavg: the DC of 99% for B1 and B2/B3 is based upon plausibility monitoring in K2/K3. This corresponds to the DCavg 
for the subsystem. The DC of 99% for the contactor Q1 is derived from readback of the contact position in the safety 
modules. Fault detection by the process yields a DC of 60% for the frequency inverter T1. Averaging thus results in a 
DCavg of 62% (“low”) for the subsystem Q1/T1. An adequate test rate of the emergency-stop device is assured (refer 
to the information in subclauses 6.2.14 and D.2.5.1).  
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure in the subsystems S1.1/S1.2, B2/B1, B3.1/B3.2 and Q1/T2 (65, 
70 or 85 points): separation (15), protection against overvoltage etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10), 
well-tried components in B2/B1 (5), diversity in Q1/T1 (20)
•	The subsystems B1/B2 and B3.1/B3.2 correspond to Category 4 with a high MTTFD and high DCavg (99%). This results 
in an average probability of dangerous failure of 3.3 · 10-8 per hour and 2.5 · 10-8 per hour. The subsystem Q1/
T1 satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTFD (68.9 years) and low DCavg (62%). This results in an average probability 
of dangerous failure of 1.8 · 10-7 per hour for the safety function of “position monitoring of interlocking devices 
(guard 1, loading)”.  \n1598 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	For the safety function of “position monitoring of interlocking devices (guard 2, unloading)”, the average probabi -
lity of dangerous failure is 2.1 · 10-7 per hour. This corresponds in both cases to PL d.
•	The average probability of dangerous failure for the emergency stop function is 2.0 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies 
PL d.

Safety function
•	Safety-related stop function, initiated by a guard: opening of the movable guard (safety guard) initiates the safety 
function STO (safe torque off).
Functional description
•	Opening of the movable guard (e.g. safety guard) is detected by two position switches B1 and B2 employing a 
break contact/make contact combination. The position switch B1 with direct opening contact actuates a contactor 
Q2, which interrupts/prevents hazardous movements or states when it drops out. The position switch B2 with 
make contact is read in by a standard PLC K1, which can bring about the same de-energization response by actua -
tion of a second contactor Q1.
•	The safety function is retained in the event of a component failure.
•	The switching position of B1 is also read into the PLC K1 by means of a make contact, and is compared for plausibi -
lity with the switching position of B2. The switching position of the contactors Q1 and Q2 is likewise monitored in 
K1 by mirror contacts. Component failures in B1, B2, Q1 and Q2 are detected by K1 and lead to operating inhibition 
owing to the dropping-out of Q1 and Q2. Faults in the PLC K1 are detected only by the function (fault detection by 
the process).  \n1618 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
(such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented.
•	A stable arrangement of the guard is assured for actuation of the position switch.
•	B1 is a position switch with a dirct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K.
•	The supply conductors to the position switches are laid separately or with protection.
•	Faults in the actuating and operating mechanism are detected by the use of two position switches differing in the 
principle of their operation (break and make contacts). 
•	Q1 and Q2 possess mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. The PLC K1 satisfies the normative 
requirements described in subclause 6.3.  
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	MTTFD: the position switch B1 with roller actuation exhibits a B10D of 20 · 106 switching cycles [M]. For position 
switch B2 (make contact), the B10D is 100,000 switching cycles [M]. At 365 working days, 16 working hours per day 
and a cycle time of 1 hour, nop for these components is 5,840 cycles per year and the MTTFD is 34,246.6 years for B1 
and 171 years for B2. For the contactors Q1 and Q2, the B10 value corresponds under inductive load (AC 3) to an elec -
trical durability of 1,300,000 switching cycles [M]. On the assumption that 50% of failures are dangerous, the B10D 
value is produced by doubling of the B10 value. The above assumed value for nop results in an MTTFD of 4,452 years 
for Q1 and Q2. An MTTF  value of 15 years [M] is substituted for the PLC, doubling of which results in an MTTFD value 
of 30 years. The combination of B1 and Q2 results in an MTTFD of 3,940 years for the first channel; B2, K1 and Q2 
contribute to an MTTFD of 25.4 years in the second channel. Altogether, the MTTFD value symmetrized over both 
channels is 70 years per channel (“high”). The position switch B2 exhibits a limited operation time of 17 .1 years. Its 
replacement in good time is recommended.
•	DCavg: the DC of 99% for B1 and B2 is based upon plausibility monitoring of the two switching states in the PLC K1. 
The DC of 99% for the contactors Q1 and Q2 is derived from readback via mirror contacts, also in K1. Owing to the 
possibility of fault detection by the process, a DC of 60% is assumed for K1. Averaging thus produces a DCavg of 
66.2% (“low”).
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (65 points): separation (15), overvoltage protection etc. (15) and 
environmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTFD (70 years) and low DCavg (66.2%). 
This results in an average probability of dangerous failure of 1.6 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d.  \n1628 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Safety functions
•	Guard locking (PL d): access to a hazardous movement is prevented by means of a guard door with guard locking. 
•	Release of guard locking: opening of the safety guard is possible only once the motor has come to a halt.
Functional description
•	Access to a hazardous movement is prevented by a guard door with guard locking until the moving part has come 
to rest (guard locking safety function). The door is held closed by a spring-actuated pin (the locking element) of a 
solenoid that prevents the actuator being withdrawn from the switch head until the locking solenoid is actuated.
•	According to the manufacturer, the guard locking has a fail-safe locking element.  i\n1658 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
B2.2 B2.1 
K5 K4 
K2 Guard locking
Mechanic 
•	When the guard door is open, unexpected start-up of the motor is prevented in two channels by the interlock safety 
function (not shown).
•	The pin of the locking element acts directly upon the direct opening contacts B2.1 and B2.2, which are connected 
to a safety module K2.
•	The hazardous movement can be started only when the guard door is closed and guard locking activated, since the 
enabling circuits of K1 and K2 are connected in series.
•	Actuation of the stop button causes the contactor relays K4 and K5 to drop out. Once the motor has reached a 
standstill, guard locking can be opened by actuation of the latching switch S1 (safety function: release of guard 
locking). The stationary state of the motor is detected by two-channel monitoring B4, K7 .  
Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
(such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented. 
•	B1 is an electromechanical guard locking device with fail-safe locking element. 
Fault exclusion can be assumed for the mechanical components of the guard locking device, including mechanical 
failure of the locking element and the actuator, when the following conditions are met:
 –Use in accordance with the operating manual, in particular the installation instructions and technical data  
(e.g. actuating radius, actuating velocity)
 –Prevention of working loose
 –The static forces on the guard locking device are lower than the locking force stated on the data sheet
 –No dynamic forces arise, since current flows through the unlocking solenoid only when the guard door is closed; 
refer in this context also to DGUV Informative publication 203-079 concerning the selection and fitting of inter -
locking devices
 –The device is not used as a mechanical stop
 –The actuator is mounted such that it cannot be removed
 –Regular maintenance is performed
 –Positive coupling following fitting
 –Adequate mechanical strength of all mounting and functional elements 
 –Dropping of the door does not lead to the actuator being used outside the range specified by the manufacturer
 –Damage that could be caused by foreseeable external influences (such as the ingress of dirt or dust; mechanical 
shock) is prevented by the form of mounting or need not be anticipated under the given conditions of use
•	B2.1 and B2.2 are switching elements of the guard locking device with direct opening contacts in accordance with 
IEC 60947 -5-1, Annex K. The manufacturer states a B10D value for the purposes of calculation.
•	B3 is a direct opening contact in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K, and has the purpose of monitoring the 
door position.
•	K4 and K5 possess mechanically linked contacts to IEC 60947 -5-1, Annex L.
•	The safety modules K1 and K2 detect cross-circuits and shorts to earth, and satisfy the requirements of Category 4, 
PL d of EN ISO 13849-1.
•	The stationary state monitor consists of the sin/cos encoder B4 and the standstill monitor K7 . Both satisfy the 
requirements of Category 4 and PL e.  \n1668 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	Fault exclusion can be assumed for the mechanism of the guard locking device B1.  
Note: On guard locking devices with fail-safe locking element, fault exclusion is possible only in accordance with 
the manufacturer‘s information.
•	The manufacturer states a B10D value of 3,000,000 cycles [M] each for the switching elements B2.1 and B2.2. At 
actuation once every 10 minutes, nop is 17 ,520 cycles per year and the MTTFD is 1,712 years.
•	The contactor relays K4 and K5 have a B10D value of 1,000,000 cycles [M]. At actuation once every 10 minutes, nop is 
17 ,520 cycles per year and the MTTFD is 570 years.
•	The manufacturer states a PFHD of 3.0 · 10-9 per hour [M] for the safety module K2.
•	DCavg: the DC of 99% for the contacts B2.1 and B2.2 is attributable to direct monitoring in K2. The DC of 99% for K4 
and K5 is attributable to direct monitoring in K2 by means of mechanically linked contacts. Averaging results in a 
DCavg of 99% (“high”).
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (70 points): separation (15), FMEA (5), overvoltage protection 
etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	For the safety function “access to a hazardous movement is prevented by means of a guard door with guard 
locking”, the average probability of dangerous failure PFHD is 5.2 · 10-8 per hour. This satisfies PL e. However, since 
the position switch (B2) for monitoring of the locking element and the associated actuating mechanism is present 
only once, the PL is limited to d.
•	For the safety function “release of guard locking: opening of the guard is possible only once the motor has come  
to a halt”, the probability of failure is determined only by the sin/cos encoder B4 and the standstill monitor K7 . 
According to the manufacturer‘s information, the PFHD for the sin/cos encoder B4 is 1.2 · 10-8 per hour. A PFHD of  
2.0 · 10-8 per hour is stated for the standstill monitor K7 [M]. The PFH of this safety function is 3.2 · 10-8 per hour.

Safety function
•	Safety-related stop function: following a stop command, an emergency stop command or tripping of a protective 
device, the drive is halted (SS1-t – safe stop 1, STO is activated with a time delay). 
Functional description
•	The hazardous movement is interrupted redundantly if either the stop button S1 or the protective device K3 – 
shown in the circuit diagram as electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE) – is activated. The drive is halted in 
an emergency following actuation of the emergency stop device S4. In all three cases, stopping is initiated via the 
output O3 of the PLC K4 by deactivation of the “Start/Stop” input on the frequency inverter (FI) T1. Redundantly to 
this process, the input “STO2” on T1 is deactivated by de-energization of the contactor relay K1 (with the use of the 
capacitor C1 for drop-out delay). A further shut-off path exists on the “STO1” input on T1 via the output O2 of the 
PLC K4: this also causes the brake Q2 to be applied. The first shut-off path is thus implemented directly by the PLC 
K4; conversely, the second shut-off path employs relay technology and delayed drop-out. The timer settings for 
O2 in the PLC program and for K1 are selected such that the machine movement is halted even under unfavourable 
 operating conditions.  \n1698 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

•	Should a “fast stop” input with a particularly short deceleration phase be available on the FI, an ESPE may be 
 connected to it if desired, as shown on the circuit diagram. This option is not considered further below.
•	In the event of failure of the PLC K4, the “Start/Stop”, “STO1” or “STO2” frequency inverter inputs, the contactor 
relay K1 with drop-out delay or the contactor relay K2, stopping of the drive is nevertheless assured, since two 
mutually independent shut-off paths are always present. Failure of the contactor relays K1 or K2 to drop out is 
detected – at the latest before renewed start-up of the machine movement – by the feedback of the mechanically 
linked break-contact elements to the PLC inputs I3 and I4.  
Design features
•	Basic and well-tried safety principles are observed and the requirements of Category B are met. Protective circuits 
(such as contact protection) as described in the initial paragraphs of Chapter 8 are implemented.
•	Owing to the use of an FI with STO, the contactor Q1 is no longer absolutely essential for de-energization of the 
supply voltage. The FI must be suitable for ramping up and braking.
•	For comparison of command disconnection on the “STO1/STO2” inputs on the FI, a duration of sufficient length is 
selected to allow for variation in the drop-out delay of K1.
•	The contactor relays K1 and K2 possess mechanically linked contact elements in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, 
Annex L.
•	The contacts of the stop button S1 and of the emergency stop device S4 are direct opening contacts in accordance 
with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K.
•	The standard component K4 is employed in accordance with the information in subclause 6.3.10.
•	The software (SRASW) is programmed in accordance with the requirements for PL c (downgraded owing to diver -
sity) and the guidance in subclause 6.3.10.
•	If the brake Q2 is provided for functional reasons only, i.e. it is not involved in performance of the safety function, 
it is disregarded in the calculation of the probability of failure, as in this example. A condition for this procedure 
is that coasting down of the drive in the event of a failure of the stop function, in which case de-energization is 
 effected by means of STO alone, must not be associated with an unacceptably high residual risk. The involvement 
of a brake in performance of the safety function in conjunction with the use of an FI is described in Example 23 
(revolving door control).
•	The ESPE K3, for example in the form of a light curtain, satisfies the requirements for Type 4 to IEC 61496-1 and 
IEC 61496-2, and for PL e.  
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	The probability of failure PFHD of safe stopping initiated by the emergency stop device S4 or by the ESPE is calcu-
lated. The “fast stop” function of the FI and the facility for de-energization of the power supply to the FI via Q1 are 
not considered in the calculation of the probability of failure of the safety function.
•	The FI T1 with STO is available for purchase as a safety component; its probability of failure is added at the end 
of the calculation (1.5 · 10-8 per hour [M]). The stop function of the FI is modelled in the first channel of the block 
diagram (T1stop). The FI with STO would in fact be modelled in the second channel of the block diagram; a model 
with a turnkey safety component including PFHD in a single channel is however not covered by the standard. The 
FI T1 and its STO function are therefore considered as a single subsystem. This estimation therefore errs on the safe 
side.  \n1708 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
Safe stop initiated by the emergency stop device S4:
•	MTTFD: the following MTTFD values are estimated: 50 years for K4 and 100 years for the stop function T1stop of  
the FI [E]. At a B10D value of 100,000 cycles [S] each and an nop of 12 cycles per year, the MTTFD for S4.1 and S4.2 is 
83,333 years. At a B10D value of 400,000 cycles [S] and at 240 working days, 8 working hours and a cycle time of 
6 minutes, the nop for K1 is 19,200 cycles per year and the MTTFD 208 years. At a B10D value of 400,000 cycles [S] and 
actuation once daily on 240 working days, the MTTFD for K2 is 16,667 years. The capacitor C1 is considered in the 
calculation with an MTTFD of 45,662 years [D]. These values yield a symmetrized MTTFD of each channel of 72 years 
(“high”).
•	DCavg: fault detection by the process results in a DC of 60% for T1stop, and in combination with internal self-tests 
in a DC of 60% for K4. Testing of the timing element with the FI de-energized results in a DC of 99% for K1. Testing 
of the timing element with the FI de-energized in combination with fault detection by comparison in the FI at a 
demand of the safety function results in a DC of 90% for C1. For S4.1, S4.2 and K2, DC is 99% owing to plausibility 
testing in K4. An adequate test rate of the emergency-stop device is assured (refer to the information in subclauses 
6.2.14 and D.2.5.1). The averaging formula for DCavg returns a result of 65% (“low”).
•	Adequate measures against common cause failure (85 points): separation (15), diversity (20), overvoltage protec -
tion etc. (15) and environmental conditions (25 + 10)
•	The combination of the control elements satisfies Category 3 with a high MTTFD of each channel (72 years) and  
a low DCavg (65%). Together with the FI T1, this results in an average probability of dangerous failure PFHD of  
1.7 · 10-7 per hour. This satisfies PL d.  
Safe stop initiated by the ESPE K3:
•	The ESPE K3 is available as a commercial safety component. Its probability of failure PFHD is 3.0 · 10-8 per hour [M], 
and is added at the end of the calculation.
•	The probability of failure of the “PLC/electromechanical” two-channel structure is calculated using the same MTTFD 
and DC values as above. The component K2 however is not involved in performance of this safety function. The 
results are: an MTTFD for each channel of 72 years (“high”) and a DCavg of 65% (“low”). For Category 3, this yields an 
average probability of dangerous failure PFHD of 1.5 · 10-7 per hour. The overall probability of failure is determined by 
addition, resulting in a PFHD of 2.0 · 10-7 per hour. This also satisfies PL d.

reduced	successfully 	to	the	limited 	value	by	means	of	T1,	K1	can	initiate	a	halt 	by	blocking	the	start/stop	signal 	and	
servo	enable	on	the	frequency 	inverter.	The	power	supply 	to	T1	is	also	interrupted 	by	the	mains	contactor	relay 	Q1	
after	a	programmed 	timeout.
•	The	two-channel 	safety	PLC	K1	performs 	internal	fault	detection.	 Should	one	processing	channel 	fail,	the	remaining	
(i.e.	functioning)	processing	channel 	reduces	the	speed	of	the	frequency 	inverter	T1	and	de-energizes 	the	mains	
contactor	relay 	Q1.	A	failure	of 	the	frequency 	inverter	that 	could	for	example	lead 	to	unexpected 	start-up,	continued 	
running	or	an	increase	in	the	speed 	is	detected	by	separate	monitoring	of 	the	speed	by	the	rotary	encoders	G1	and	
G2	in	the	two	processing	channels.	Failure	of 	the	mains	contactor	relay 	Q1	to	drop	out 	is	detected	by	the	break-
contact	element	connected	to	both	processing	channels 	(inputs	I2.0	and	I2.1	of	K1),	and	leads	both	to	blocking	of 	
the	start/stop	signal 	and	of	servo	enable	on	the	inverter	by 	both	processing	channels. 	\n1738 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.	Protective	circuits 	
(such	as	contact	protection)	as 	described	in	the	initial 	paragraphs 	of	Chapter	8	are	implemented.
•	A	stable	arrangement 	of	the	safeguard 	is	assured	for	actuation	of 	the	position	switch.
•	The	position	switch	B1	features 	direct	opening	action	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-5-1,	Annex 	K.	The	position	
switch	B2	also	complies 	with	IEC	60947-5-1.
•	The	contactor	Q1	possesses 	a	mirror	contact 	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-4-1,	Annex 	F.
•	The	supply	conductors 	to	the	position	switches 	are	laid	either	separately 	or	with	protection	against 	mechanical 	
damage.
•	For	the	“safely 	limited	speed”	safety 	function,	a	fault 	exclusion	is 	assumed	for	the	fault 	condition	of 	encoder	
shaft	breakage	(G1/G2).	Details 	of	the	possibility 	of	a	fault	exclusion	can	be	found 	for	example	in	IEC 	61800-5-2,	
Table D.8,	and 	GS-IFA-M21.
•	The	standard 	components 	G1	and	G2	(where	relevant 	for	the	rotary 	encoders)	and 	T1	are	employed 	in	accordance	
with	the	information	in	subclause	6.3.10.
•	The	safety	component 	K1	satisfies 	all	requirements 	for	Category 	3	and	PL	d.	The	software	(SRASW)	is 	programmed 	
in	accordance	with	the	requirements 	for	PL	d	and	the	information	in	subclause	6.3.10.
•	It	is	assumed	that	each	output 	of	the	safety	PLC	is	actuated	by	both	processing	channels 	of	the	PLC	and	that	the	
analog	output 	03	is	monitored	by	two	channels.
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	The	SRP/CS	is	divided	into	the	two	subsystems 	sensor/actuator	and 	PLC.	For	the	PLC 	subsystem,	a	tested 	safety	
PLC	suitable	for	PL 	d	is	employed.	 This	PLC‘s	probability 	of	failure	of	1.5	·	10-7	per	hour	[E]	is 	added	at	the	end	of	the	
calculation	for	the	sensor/actuator	subsystem.	For	the	composition	of 	the	block	diagram,	refer	also	to	Figure	6.14	
and	the	relevant 	information	in	the	associated 	text.	The	probability 	of	failure	for	the	sensor/actuator	subsystem	is 	
calculated	below.
•	MTTFD:	at	240	working	days,	8	working	hours 	and	a	cycle	time	of 	one	hour,	nop	is	1,920	cycles 	per	year.	A	B10D	value	
of	20,000,000	cycles 	[S]	is	assumed	for	the	position	switch	B1	owing	to	its 	direct	opening	action;	the	associated 	
MTTFD	value	is	104,166.7	years.	Owing	to	the	defined 	control	current	(low	load;	the	mechanical 	durability	of	the	con-
tacts	is	the	determining	factor),	a	B10D	value	of	100,000	cycles 	[E]	is	assumed	for	the	make-contact 	element,	which	
is	opened	by	spring	force	(see	also	 Table	D.2),	and 	therefore	an	 MTTFD	of	520	years.	The	contactor	Q1,	with	a	B10D	
value	of	400,000	cycles,	switches 	operationally 	only	once	daily,	equating	to	an	nop	of	240	cycles	per	year	and	an	
MTTFD	of	16,667	years.	The	following	manufacturer‘s 	values	are	available:	an	 MTTFD	of	100	years	for	T1	and	an	MTTFD	
of	190	years	for	G1/G2	[M].	 These	values	yield	a	symmetrized 	MTTFD	of	each	channel 	of	84	years	(“high”).
•	DCavg:	a	DC	of	99%	is	assumed	for	each	of	the	components 	used.	For	the	position	switches 	and	the	rotary	encoders,	
this	value	is	based	upon	cross 	monitoring	of 	input	signals	in	K1.	For	the	frequency 	inverter	T1,	the	speed 	is	moni-
tored	in	the	safety 	PLC	via	the	two	rotary 	encoders,	and 	fault	detection	is 	provided	by	the	process;	the	main	contac -
tor	relay	Q1	is	monitored	directly	by	the	PLC.	These	values	yield	a	DCavg	of	99%	(“high”). 	\n1748 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	(70	points):	separation	(15),	FMEA	(5),	overvoltage	protection	
etc.	(15)	and 	environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	The	sensor/actuator	subsystem	satisfies 	Category	3	with	a	high	 MTTFD	of	each	channel 	(84	years)	and	high	 DCavg	
(99%).	This	results	in	an	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	 PFHD	of	3.0	·	10-8	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	e.		
A	PLr	of	d	is	thus	surpassed,	which	with	the	required 	two-channel 	design	of	the	hardware	with	few	components,	the	
use	of	B10D	values	in	accordance	with	the	standard,	a	 DC	of	“high”	and 	a	“moderate”	rate	of 	operations 	will	virtually	
always	be	the	case.
•	The	overall	probability 	of	failure	is	determined 	by	addition	of 	the	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	K1	(1.5	·	10-7	per	
hour)	and	is	PFHD	=	1.8	·	10-7	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	d.

Functional description
•	A	triple-beam	light 	barrier	(ESPE)	F5	of 	Type	4	to	IEC 	61496	safeguards 	the	access	to	the	discharge	point 	of	the	pal-
letizer	station.	 The	light	barrier	embodies 	the	additional 	functions	of	start	interlock	and	restart	interlock,	which	are	
implemented 	by	means	of	two	antivalent 	inputs.	Disabling	of 	the	start	interlock	of	the	light	barrier	is	coupled	to	the	
start	command	for	the	belt	drive,	i.e.	energization	 of	the	palletizer	station,	and	is	initiated	by	picking-up	 and	subse-
quent	dropping-out 	of	the	contactor	relay 	K1	in	response	to	actuation	and 	release	of	the	start	button	S1.	A	condition	
for	a	valid	start	command	is	that	the	contactor	relays 	K2	and	K3	have	dropped 	out	(queried	via	input	I1.1)	and	that	
the	start	interlock	has	been	cancelled 	(queried	via	input	I1.0).	Output 	O1.1	is	set	as	a	result.
•	Four	infrared 	light	sensors	F1	to	F4	(for	arrangement,	refer	also	to	Figure	8.44)	are	incorporated 	for	control	of	the	
muting	process.	 Via	the	inputs 	I1.2	to	I1.5,	the	PLC 	monitors	the	actuation	sequence	of 	the	four	infrared 	light	sen-
sors	via	the	sensor‘s 	contacts	F1.1	to	F4.1,	in	consideration	of 	two	programmed 	time	settings.	 The	muting	function	
is	implemented 	only	in	the	output 	circuit	of	the	PLC	(output	O1.2),	independently 	of	the	output	circuit	of	the	light	
barrier	F5.	The	muting	contacts 	F1.2	and	F2.2/F3.2	and 	F4.2,	connected 	in	series,	are	connected 	by	OR	logic	via	the	
diodes	R2	and	R3	respectively 	with	the	“enabling”	function	implemented 	by	the	contactor	relays 	K2	and	K3.

•	R2	and	R3	cause	the	muting	function	to	be	displayed 	correctly,	and 	isolate	the	activated 	enabling	output 	from	the	
muting	displays 	P1/P2	when	the	muting	function	is 	not	active.	Faults 	in	R2	or	R3	cannot 	lead	to	unexpected 	muting	
(i.e.	dangerous 	failure	of	the	muting	function).
•	Should	the	voltage	break 	down	and	be	restored,	or	the	light 	barrier	F5	be	interrupted 	and	the	muting	function	not 	
be	active,	the	contactor	relays 	K2	and	K3	are	de-energized.	 The	absence	of 	latching-in	under	these	circumstances 	
prevents	them	from	picking	up	again	should 	the	muting	circuits 	be	closed	again.	The	installation	can	be	restarted 	
only	by	disabling	of 	the	restart	interlock,	i.e.	by 	deliberate	actuation	and 	release	of	the	start	button	S1.
•		For	starting	or	restarting	as 	intended,	for	example	following	a	fault 	on	the	installation,	the	key 	switch	S3	must	be	
actuated.	In	the	event 	of	an	outage,	the	operator	can	eject 	a	pallet	from	the	detection	 zone	of	the	light	barrier	and 	
the	muting	sensors 	by	means	of	the	hold-to-run	button	 S4.
For	smooth	progress 	of	the	pallets 	through	the	discharge	opening,	two	time	settings 	in	the	PLC	program	must 	be	
matched	to	the	velocity	of	the	transport 	movement:
	–The	time	setting	 T1	determines 	the	maximum	period 	within	which	–	following	activation	of 	the	sensor	F1	–	the	
sensor	F2	must 	be	activated 	and	the	muting	function	thus 	initiated	by	the	transported 	product.
	–Time	setting	 T2	begins	with	renewed 	clearing	of	the	sensor	F2.	 T2	must	be	selected 	such	that	when	the	detection	
zone	of	the	light	barriers	becomes	clear	again,	K1	is 	energized	and	de-energized 	again	before	sensor	F3	is 	deacti-
vated	by	the	transported 	product	and	the	muting	function	thereby 	terminated.
•	Failure	of	the	contactor	relays 	K2	and	K3	to	drop	out 	is	detected	at	the	latest	before	the	belt 	drive/the	palletizer	
station	start 	up	again,	owing	to	the	feedback 	of	the	mechanically 	linked	break	contacts	to	the	PLC	input	I1.1.	Failure	
of	K1	is	detected	at	the	next	discharge	of 	a	pallet.
•	Unintended 	start-up	of	the	belt	drive/palletizer	station	by 	themselves 	in	the	event 	of	the	loss	and	subsequent 	
restoration	of 	power	or	a	failure	of 	the	standard 	PLC	is	prevented	by	the	function	of 	the	start-up	and 	restart	inter-
lock.	The	PLC	can	disable	the	restart 	interlock	only	immediately 	after	the	pallet 	has	passed	the	light	barrier,	i.e.	
whilst	sensors	F3	and	F4	are	still	activated.
•	The	failure	of 	individual	muting	sensors 	is	either	detected 	directly	by	the	PLC	program	(owing	to	monitoring	for	
	proper	completion	of 	activation	and 	deactivation),	or	becomes 	evident	by	operating	inhibition	during	transport 	of	
the	pallet.
•	Failure	of	the	hold-to-run	button	 S4,	which	is 	used	only	for	the	clearing	of 	faults	(manual	muting),	is 	detected	
directly	by	the	operator.

•	When	muting	sensors 	are	used	that	employ	microcontrollers 	and	software	that 	have	not	been	subjected 	to	a	safety	
analysis	by	the	manufacturer	(i.e.	the	requirements 	imposed	upon	safety-related 	embedded 	software	are	not 	met),	
components 	featuring	diverse	technology 	must	be	employed 	in	the	two	channels 	in	the	intended 	PL	of	d.
•	In	accordance	with	EN	415-4,	it 	can	be	assumed 	that	the	unobserved 	access	of	persons	through	feed 	or	discharge	
openings	is	prevented	sufficiently 	reliably	when	requirements 	including	the	following	are	met:
	–Use	of	a	two-beam	or	three-beam	light 	barrier	in	consideration	of 	the	necessary 	installation	height 	(with	the	
access	point	open/an	empty 	pallet	present	in	it),	or
	–Muting	of	the	protective	function	of 	the	light	barrier	by	the	loaded 	pallet	with	clearances 	to	the	side	of 	less	than	
0.2	m,	and	muting	activated 	by	the	pallet	load	only	immediately 	prior	to	interruption	of 	the	light	beams	(without	
greater	timing	intervals 	and	geometrical 	gaps).
Calculation of the probability of failure
In	the	calculation	below,	a	 DC	of	0%	is	assumed	for	the	output 	relays	of	the	muting	sensors 	F1	to	F4,	since	the	con -
tacts	employed	for	muting	are	not 	subject	to	automatic 	fault	detection.	For	this 	reason,	periodic 	manual	inspection	
that	can	be	achieved 	by	simple	means 	is	specified.
•	MTTFD:	an	MTTFD	of	100	years	[E]	is	assumed	for	the	sensor	part 	of	each	of	the	muting	sensors 	F1	to	F4.	A	B10D	value	
of	2,000,000	cycles 	[E]	applies	for	the	output 	relays	of	F1	to	F4.	At	300	working	days,	16	working	hours 	and	a	
cycle	time	of 	200	seconds,	nop		is	86,400	cycles 	per	year	and	the	MTTFD	232	years	for	these	elements.	An	 MTTFD	of	
35 years	(“high”)	is	produced	for	the	channel.
•	DCavg:	a	DC	of	90%	is	attained	for	the	sensor	part 	of	the	muting	sensors 	F1	to	F4	by	way	of	the	PLC	monitoring.	 The	
DC	for	the	output 	relays	is	estimated	erring	on	the	safe	side	at 	0%.	The	resulting	 DCavg	value	is	63%	(“low”).
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	(65	points):	separation	(15),	overvoltage	protection	etc.	(15)	and 	
environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	The	combination	of 	the	control 	elements	satisfies	Category	3	with	a	high	 MTTFD	of	each	channel 	(35	years)	and	a	
low	DCavg	(63%).	This	results	in	an	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	 PFHD	of	5.2	·	10-7	per	hour.	This	satisfies	
PL	d.

Functional description
•	The	revolving	movement 	of	the	door	is 	initiated	only	once	the	control 	system	has 	been	switched 	on	by	the	pushbut -
ton	S1.	In	normal 	operation,	the	command 	for	the	revolving	movement 	is	issued	by	the	motion	detector	B3	located 	
on	the	door.	 The	frequency 	inverter	T1	is	actuated	jointly	by	the	two	microcontrollers 	K1	and	K2.	Each	microcontrol -
ler	(µC)	contains 	a	central	processing	unit 	(CPU)	in	the	form	of 	a	microprocessor,	and 	working	memory 	(RAM)	and	
read-only	memory	(ROM).	K1	controls 	the	functions 	of	setpoint	assignment,	 STO1,	and	fast	stop	(T1s).	K2	actuates 	
STO2,	and	the	brake	Q1	can	be	released 	by	means	of	the	contactor	relay 	K3.	The	rotary	encoders	G1	and	G2	signal	
the	motor	speed 	to	K1	and	K2	respectively.	 The	redundant 	speed	monitoring	is 	required	for	both	safety 	functions	
(ramp	monitoring	and 	SLS),	and	is	also	used	for	monitoring	of 	the	frequency 	inverter	T1.
•	Faults	in	the	pressure-sensitive	edge	or	light 	barrier	are	detected 	in	the	associated 	control	units.	The	same	applies 	
to	faults	in	the	control 	units	themselves,	which	are	detected 	by	internal	monitoring.	Faults 	in	the	components 	of	
the	microcontrollers 	are	detected 	by	the	performance	of 	self-tests	and	by	data	comparison.	 When	detected,	faults 	
are	controlled 	via	K1	and/or	K2,	leading	to	the	door‘s 	movement 	being	halted 	by	T1	and/or	Q1.	 The	wings	of	the	
door	can	be	opened 	manually	in	order	for	trapped 	persons	to	be	freed.
•	Owing	to	redundant 	processing	channels,	a	single	fault 	does	not	result	in	loss	of	the	safety	functions.	The	combi-
nation	of	undetected 	faults	may	lead	to	loss	of	the	safety	functions.
Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.	Protective	circuits 	
(such	as	contact	protection)	as 	described	in	the	initial 	paragraphs 	of	Chapter	8	are	implemented.
•	The	pressure-sensitive	edge	serves 	as	a	safeguard 	against	crush,	shear	and 	entrapment 	points.	The	pressure-
sensitive	edge	and 	the	control 	unit	are	treated 	as	a	single	unit 	(B1).	The	subsystem	B1	satisfies 	the	requirements 	of	
EN	ISO	13856-2	in	Category 	3	and	of	EN	ISO	13849-1	for	PL 	d.	Faults	in	the	signal 	generator	of 	the	pressure-sensitive	
edge	or	in	the	supply 	conductors 	must	be	excluded 	or	be	detected 	via	the	control 	unit	(pressure-sensitive	edges 	
operating	on	either	the	break-contact 	or	make-contact 	principle	may 	be	employed).	Following	actuation	and 	sub-
sequent	release	of	pressure	upon	a	pressure-sensitive	edge,	the	rotary 	movement 	begins	again	with	a	time	delay.	
The	pressure-sensitive	edge	possesses 	an	adequate	deformation	path	and 	an	adequate	range	of 	action.
•	The	light	barrier	has 	the	function	of 	leading,	non-contact 	safeguarding	of 	hazard	zones.	The	light	barrier	system	B2	
satisfies	the	requirements 	for	Type	4	to	IEC 	61496-1	and 	IEC	61496-2	and 	for	PL	e	to	EN	ISO	13849-1.	 The	reduced,	
safely	limited	revolving	speed 	that	is	assumed	following	detection	of 	a	person	or	an	object 	by	the	light	barrier	is	
increased	again	to	the	normal 	speed	following	a	preset 	timeout.	The	supply	conductors 	to	the	transmitter	and 	
receiver	are	laid 	separately	or	with	protection.
•	During	start-up	of 	the	door‘s	revolving	movement 	for	the	first 	time,	start-up	tests 	are	performed.	 The	tests	include,	
for	example,	tests 	of	the	microcontroller	blocks 	(microprocessor,	random-access 	and	read-only	memory),	input 	and	
output	tests,	and	checking	of 	driving	of	the	motor	by 	the	frequency 	inverter	(including	testing	of 	the	fast	stop	func-
tion	and	of	STO1/STO2).	A	brake	test 	is	also	performed,	in	which	the	frequency 	inverter	is	required	to	act	against	
the	applied 	brake.
•	During	comparison	of 	data	between	the	two	controllers,	desired 	values	and	intermediate	results 	are	exchanged,	
with	inclusion	of 	the	cyclical 	self-tests.
•	Owing	to	the	use	of 	a	frequency 	inverter	with	 STO,	a	contactor	is 	no	longer	required 	for	disconnection	of 	the	supply	
voltage.	The	frequency 	inverter	is	suitable	for	driving	and 	braking.	\n1848 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	K3	possesses 	mechanically 	linked	contact	elements	to	IEC	60947-5-1,	Annex 	L.	The	switching	position	of 	the	break-
contact	element	is	monitored	by	the	microcontroller	K2	for	the	purpose	of 	fault	detection.
•	It	is	assumed	in	the	example	that 	closed-loop	control 	provided	by	the	frequency 	inverter	T1	is	sufficient	for	braking	
of	the	revolving	door.	Once	a	standstill 	has	been	reached,	 STO	is	activated	in	order	to	prevent 	unexpected 	start-
up.	The	braking	time	and 	braking	distance	are	monitored 	by	the	controller	(ramp	monitoring).	 The	brake	Q1	in	the	
second	channel	is	required	so	that,	should 	T1	no	longer	be	able	to	perform	the	fast 	stop	T1s	following	the	occur -
rence	of	a	fault,	no	danger	can	arise	owing	to	an	unexpected 	movement.	Q1	operates 	on	the	closed-circuit 	current	
principle.
•	The	software	(SRESW)	in	K1	and 	K2	is	programmed 	in	accordance	with	the	requirements 	for	PL	d	as	per	subclause	
6.3.
•	The	standard 	components 	G1	and	G2	(where	relevant 	for	the	rotary 	encoders)	and 	T1	are	employed 	in	accordance	
with	the	information	in	subclause	6.3.10.
•	For	the	safety 	functions	under	analysis,	a	fault 	exclusion	is 	assumed	for	the	fault 	condition	of 	encoder	shaft 	
breakage	(G1/G2).	For	details 	of	the	possibility 	of	a	fault	exclusion,	refer	for	example	to	IEC 	61800-5-2,	 Table	D.8/
GS-IFA-M21.
Remarks
•	The	circuit	example	can	be	employed 	for	implementation	of 	the	“safety-related 	stop	function”	and 	“safely	limited	
speed”	safety 	functions	in	a	control 	system	for	three-wing	and 	four-wing	revolving	doors 	with	break-out 	function	
(the	door	wings 	can	be	folded 	manually	in	an	emergency)	for	use	in	public 	and	commercial 	buildings.
•	Regular	manual 	inspection	of 	the	pressure-sensitive	edge	is 	required.	Firstly,	its 	serviceability 	must	be	checked;	
secondly,	the	pressure-sensitive	edge	must 	be	inspected 	visually	in	order	for	any 	damage	to	be	detected 	in	good	
time.	
Calculation of the probability of failure
Detailed	calculation	of 	the	probability 	of	failure	is	performed	for	the	safety 	function	“safety-related 	stop	function	
(SS1-r)”,	which	is 	also	shown	in	the	block 	diagram:
•	Since	the	pressure-sensitive	edge	with	the	associated 	control	unit	is	available	commercially 	as	a	safety	compo-
nent,	its	probability 	of	failure	is	added	at	the	end	of	the	calculation	(3.0	·	10-7	per	hour	[E]).
•	The	frequency 	inverter	T1	with	STO	is	also	available	for	purchase	as 	a	safety	component;	its 	probability 	of	failure	is	
added	at	the	end	of	the	calculation	(1.5	·	10-8	per	hour	[M]).	 The	fast	stop	function	 T1s	is	modelled	in	the	first	chan-
nel	of	the	block	diagram.
•	MTTFD:	the	safety-related 	components 	of	K1	and	K2	and	their	peripherals 	are	considered,	following	application	of 	
the	parts	count	method,	by 	a	value	of	878	years	[E].	A	value	of	190	years	[M]	is	substituted 	in	the	formula	for	G1	
and	G2.	A	value	of	100	years	[M]	is	applied	for	T1s.	A	B10D	value	of	400,000	cycles 	[S]	is	substituted 	for	K3.	At	one	
actuation	per	day,	nop	is	365	cycles	per	year,	and	the	MTTFD	is	10,959	years.	A	B10D	value	of	1,000,000	cycles 	[M]	is	
substituted 	for	Q1,	resulting	in	an	 MTTFD	of	27,397	years.	The	brake	Q1	is 	required	only	in	the	event 	of	a	fault,	and 	is	
not	subject	to	operational 	wear.	Overall,	the	symmetrized 	MTTFD	value	for	the	two	channels 	is	82	years	(“high”).
•	DCavg:	owing	to	internal 	self-tests	and	comparison,	the	 DC	for	K1	and	K2	is	60%.	Internal 	self-tests	are	performed 	on	
the	microcontroller	components.	Ramp	monitoring	 yields	a	DC	of	99%	for	the	block 	T1s.	Owing	to	the	comparison	
performed	by	way	of	K1	and	K2,	G1	and	G2	are	rated 	with	a	 DC	of	99%.	With	direct	monitoring	of 	a	read-back 	mecha-
nically	linked	contact	element,	K3	is 	rated	accordingly 	with	a	 DC	of	99%.	Owing	to	performance	of 	the	static	start-
up	test,	a	 DC	of	30%	is	substituted 	for	Q1.	Averaging	thus 	yields	a	DCavg	of	95%	(“medium”).
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	(70	points):	separation	(15),	FMEA	(5),	overvoltage	protection	
etc.	(15)	and 	environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	The	combination	of 	the	control 	elements	satisfies	Category	3	with	a	high	 MTTFD	of	each	channel 	(82	years)	and	
medium	 DCavg	(95%).	This	yields	an	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	 PFHD	of	4.3	·	10-8	per	hour.	Together	
with	the	sensor	unit 	B1	(consisting	of 	a	pressure-sensitive	edge	and 	control	unit)	and	the	frequency 	inverter	T1,	
the	overall	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	the	control 	for	this	safety	function	is	3.6	·	10-7	per	hour.	This	
satisfies	PL	d.	\n1858 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
Calculation of the probability of failure for the “safely limited speed (SLS)” safety function
•	For	this	analysis,	the	sensor	unit 	B1	in	the	first 	example	analysis 	is	replaced	by	the	light	barrier	system	B2	with	
a	probability 	of	failure	of	1.5	·	10-9	per	hour	[E].	Addition	 yields	an	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	the	
control	system	for	this 	safety	function	of 	6.0	·	10-8	per	hour.	The	implementation	of 	the	safety	function	SLS	satisfies	
PL d.

Functional description
•	The	remote	I/O	module	K1	registers 	the	states	of	the	position	switch	with	personnel 	safety	function	B1	fitted 	to	the	
safeguard	and	of	the	inching	button	 S1,	and	makes	these	states 	available	on	the	functional 	bus.	This	information	
is	interpreted 	by	the	functional 	PLC	K3	and	results	in	the	stop	function	on	the	frequency 	inverter	T1	being	initiated 	
when	the	guard 	door	is	opened.	A	signal 	for	the	fastest 	possible	stop	is 	transmitted 	over	the	functional 	bus	for	this	
purpose.	The	I/O	module	K2	and 	the	monitoring	PLC 	K4,	which	communicate	over	a	dedicated 	monitoring	bus,	
operate	redundantly 	to	K1	and	K3.	The	deceleration	ramp	is 	monitored	in	the	functional 	PLC	K3	through	the	enco -
der	G2	and	in	the	monitoring	PLC 	K4	through	the	encoder	G1.	Once	a	standstill 	has	been	reached,	or	in	the	event 	
of	detection	of 	a	fault	during	stopping,	the	integral 	STO	safety	function	is	initiated	by	K3	and	K4	via	the	two	 STO	
inputs	STO1	and	STO2	of	T1.
•	The	open	state	of 	the	safeguard 	is	detected	in	K3	and	K4	via	B1,	K1	and 	K2	as	described	above.	K3	and 	K4	then	
monitor	the	specified 	limited	speed	(SLS)	redundantly 	of	each	other	through	G2	and 	G1.	If	this	speed	is	exceeded,	
K3	and	K4	initiate	 SS1-r	independently 	of	each	other,	as 	described	above.
•	With	B1	actuated,	only 	inching	mode	by 	means	of	S1	with	safely 	limited	speed	is	permissible.	Releasing	of 	S1	is	
detected	redundantly 	in	K1	to	K4	and 	leads,	as	described	above	for	the	safety-related 	stop	function	and 	SLS,	to	
safe	stop	1	of 	the	drive	(SS1-r).
•	In	accordance	with	EN	1010-1,	a	single	position	switch	B1	is 	sufficient.	The	majority 	of	faults	in	S1	are	detected 	and	
controlled	by	a	special	actuating	procedure,	which	forces 	a	signal	change:	when	 S1	is	pressed	for	the	first 	time,	an	
acoustic	warning	(signal 	generator	P1)	is 	output;	only 	when	S1	is	released	and	pressed	again	does 	the	drive	start 	
up,	with	delay.
•	Faults	in	K1	and	K2	are	detected 	by	a	status	comparison	in	K4.	K4	also	monitors 	K3	by	monitoring	the	input 	and	
output	information.	 Some	faults 	in	K3	also	become	evident 	through	faults 	in	the	process.	 Self-tests	(e.g.	temporal 	
program	sequence	monitoring	by 	an	internal 	watchdog)	are	performed 	in	K4;	in	addition,	K3	uses 	K4	for	regular	
selection	of 	STO1,	and	monitors	the	feedback 	signal	from	T1.
•	Together	with	the	sin/cos 	encoder	G1,	the	frequency 	inverter	T1	forms	a	closed-loop	control 	system	in	which	faults 	
(printing	errors,	paper	tears)	are	revealed 	by	the	production	process,	which	is 	highly	synchronous.	 The	encoder	
	signals	from	G1	on	the	motor	shaft 	are	also	read 	into	K4	and 	monitored	in	T1	for	plausibility 	of	the	sin/cos 	infor-
mation	(sin2	+	cos2	=	1).	Redundantly 	to	this,	the	signals 	from	a	diversely 	engineered 	encoder	G2	on	the	machine	
shaft are	also	interpreted.	Although	the	two	encoders 	are	not	located	on	the	same	shaft,	their	 values,	read 	into			
K4/K3	and	converted	into	paper	speeds,	can	be	compared 	in	K4,	thereby 	providing	fault 	detection	for	G1	and 	G2.	
Fault	detection	for	 STO1	in	T1	is	implemented 	by	provision	of 	a	feedback 	signal	that	is	interpreted 	in	K3.	Correct 	
execution	of 	STO2	is	monitored	by	internal	test	measures	in	T1;	in	the	event 	of	a	fault,	these	measures 	initiate	stop -
ping.	
Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.	Protective	circuits 	
(such	as	contact	protection)	as 	described	in	the	initial 	paragraphs 	of	Chapter	8	are	implemented.
•	The	break	contacts	of	B1	satisfy	IEC	60947-5-1,	Annex 	K,	and	B1	complies 	with	DGUV	Information	203-079	governing	
the	selection	and 	fitting	of	interlocking	devices.	Measures 	are	implemented 	to	prevent	displacement 	and	reasona-
bly	foreseeable	misuse	(see	EN	ISO	14119).	A	stable	arrangement 	of	the	safeguard 	is	assured	for	actuation	of 	the	
position	switch. 	\n1888 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	S1	satisfies 	IEC	60947-5-1;	short-circuiting	between	adjacent 	contacts	that	are	isolated 	from	each	other	can	there -
fore	be	excluded.	Despite	the	warning	at 	start-up	and 	forced	dynamics,	 S1	may	stick	during	inching	mode.	An	addi -
tional	requirement 	is	therefore	that 	an	emergency 	stop	device	be	installed 	within	the	operator‘s 	reach.
•	The	conditions 	for	fault	exclusion	for	conductor	short 	circuits	in	accordance	with	EN	ISO	13849-2,	 Table	D.4	must 	be	
observed	for	the	connecting	lines 	to	S1.	Faults	in	the	connecting	lines 	to	B1	are	detected 	by	monitoring	in	K4.
•	The	programmable	components 	K1	to	K4	satisfy 	the	normative	requirements 	in	accordance	with	subclause	6.3.
•	G1	is	integrated	into	the	closed-loop	control 	circuit	(acquisition	of 	the	commutation).	 The	encoder	G2,	which	is 	
engineered 	with	diversity,	has 	the	purpose	of 	fault	detection.
•	The	standard 	components 	G1	and	G2	are	employed 	in	accordance	with	the	information	in	subclause	6.3.10.
•	T1	possesses 	an	integrated 	STO	safety	function,	which	satisfies 	all	requirements 	for	Category 	3	and	PL	d.	The	
	required	fault	detection	is 	attained	by	provision	and 	external	monitoring	of 	a	feedback 	signal	for	STO1	and	by	inter-
nal	monitoring	measures 	for	STO2.
•	The	bus	systems	(functional 	bus,	monitoring	bus)	are	employed 	in	accordance	with	the	information	in	sub -
clause 6.2.18.

intervention	in	the	hazard 	zone,	i.e.	less 	frequently	than	one	intervention	per	hour,	EN	1010-1	requires 	only	one	
position	switch	for	monitoring	of 	the	guard	position.	The	fault-tolerance	criterion	for	Category 	3	generally 	requires	
the	use	of	two	position	switches 	for	similar	machine	control 	systems.
•	For	inching	mode	subject 	to	the	condition	that 	safely	limited	speed	is	already	guaranteed,	the	possibility 	of	avoi-
ding	the	hazard 	can	be	assumed 	under	certain	conditions.	For	risk 	assessment,	refer	also	to	Example	4	in	Annex 	A.	
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	The	three	safety 	functions	differ	only	on	the	sensor	level.	B1,	G1	and 	S1	are	therefore	described 	separately.
•	The	two	contacts 	with	direct	opening	action	of 	B1	are	integrated 	into	the	downstream	Category 	3	structure.	A	B10D	
value	of	20,000,000	cycles 	[S]	is	assumed	per	contact.	At 	10	actuations 	per	week,	nop	is	520	cycles	per	year	and	the	
MTTFD	is	384,615	years.	Under	the	particular	requirements 	of	EN	1010-1	for	B1	(refer	to	the	design	features),	a	 DC	of	
60%	(cross 	monitoring	of 	input	signals	without	dynamic	test,	infrequent 	signal	change	caused 	by	the	application)	
is	assumed.
•	G1	and	G2	are	also	each	integrated 	into	a	channel 	of	the	downstream	Category 	3	structure.	 Their	contribution	to	
determining	of 	the	PFHD	is	an	MTTFD	of	30	years	per	channel 	[M],	90%	 DC	for	G2	by	plausibility 	check	and	99%	 DC	
for	G1	by	monitoring	for	sin2	+	cos2	=	1,	plausibility 	checking	and 	fault	detection	in	the	process.
•	S1	possesses 	a	B10D	value	of	100,000	cycles 	[M].	At	10	actuations 	per	week,	nop	is	520	cycles	per	year	and	the	MTTFD	
is	1,923	years.	Owing	to	the	forced 	signal	change	and 	start-up	warning,	 S1	is	modelled	as	a	Category	2	subsystem,	
and	a	DC	of	at	least	60%	is	assumed	(sticking	following	repeated 	inching	is	not	detected,	however).	 Testing	is	
performed	in	K1	and	K3,	the	probability 	of	failure	of	which	is	already	considered 	in	the	downstream	Category 	3	
subsystem	and 	need	not	therefore	also	be	considered 	in	addition	in	the	test 	channel.	So	as	not	to	provoke	an	error	
message	in	 SISTEMA,	an	 MTTFD	value	of	100	years	is	substituted 	in	the	test	channel.	Since	testing	is 	performed	
immediately 	upon	demand 	of	the	safety	function,	an	adequate	test 	rate	is	assured.	The	separate	subsystem	of 	S1	
thus	attains	an	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	5.3	·	10-7	per	hour.	Since	it	is	not	practicable	for	the	con -
trol	system	to	bring	about 	the	safe	state	automatically 	in	the	event 	of	the	inching	button	sticking,	and 	the	PLr	is	not	
greater	than	c,	involvement 	of	the	operator	is 	also	permissible	(see	subclause	6.2.5).
•	K1	+	K3	and 	K2	+	K4	are	considered 	in	two	channels 	of	a	Category	3	subsystem	in	all 	three	safety 	functions	under	
analysis.	100	 years	[M]	for	K1	and 	K2,	50	years	[M]	for	K4	and 	30	years	[M]	for	K3	are	substituted 	for	the	 MTTFD.	The	
DC	of	99%	for	K1	and 	K2	is	produced	by	direct	comparison	of 	the	supplied 	status	information	in	K4.	 The	DC	of	99%		\n1898 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
for	K3	is	based	upon	parallel 	processing	of 	all	safety-related 	information	in	K4	and 	upon	the	direct 	comparison	in	
K4	with	the	intermediate	results 	and	output	signals	formed	by	K3.	The	self-tests 	implemented 	in	K4	together	with	
partial	monitoring	by 	the	selection	of 	STO1	read	back	by	K3	result	in	a	DC	of	60%	for	K4.
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	(70	points):	separation	(15),	FMEA	(5),	overvoltage	protection	
etc.	(15)	and 	environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	T1,	including	its 	integrated	safety	function	STO,	is	considered 	in	the	analysis 	as	an	encapsulated 	subsystem	with	
Category	3,	PL	d	and	a	PFHD	of	1.5	·	10-10	per	hour.
•	The	safety-related 	stop	function	and 	the	safely	limited	speed	are	engineered 	as	a	continuous 	Category	3	subsys-
tem	comprising	B1.1/B1.2,	G2/G1	and 	K1	to	K4,	which	is 	combined	with	T1	to	form	an	encapsulated 	Category	3	sub-
system.	For	the	first 	subsystem,	a	medium	 MTTFD	per	channel 	of	14.5	years	and	a	medium	 DCavg	of	91%	yield	a	PFHD	
of	7.1	·	10-7	per	hour.	Combination	with	 T1	(PFHD	=	1.5	·	10-10	per	hour)	yields	a	PFHD	of	7.1	·	10-7	per	hour	for	both	safety 	
functions.	This	satisfies	PL	d.
•	Inching	mode	is 	implemented 	by	a	combination	of 	the	Category 	2	subsystem	 S1	(PFHD	=	5.3	·	10-7	per	hour)	with	
the	two	Category 	3	subsystems 	comprising	 T1	(PFHD	=	1.5	·	10-10	per	hour)	and 	G2/G1	together	with	K1	to	K4.	 With	
a	medium	 MTTFD	per	channel 	of	14.5	years	and	a	medium	 DCavg	of	91%,	the	second 	Category	3	subsystem	attains 	
a	PFHD	of	7.1	·	10-7	per	hour.	Combination	of 	the	three	subsystems 	yields	a	PFHD	of	1.2	·	10-6	per	hour.	This	satisfies

Functional description
•	Hazardous	movements 	are	controlled 	redundantly 	by	directional 	control	valves.	Movements 	can	be	halted 	either	by	
the	directional 	control	valve	1V1	or	by 	the	directional 	control	valves	2V2	and	2V3.	The	latter	are	driven	by 	the	control 	
valve	2V1.
•	Failure	of	one	of	these	valves	alone	does 	not	result	in	loss	of	the	safety	function.
•	All	directional 	control	valves	are	actuated 	cyclically	in	the	process.
•	The	functioning	of 	the	control 	valve	2V1	is 	monitored	by	means	of	a	pressure	switch	2S1.	Certain	faults 	on	the	
unmonitored 	valves	become	apparent 	in	the	work 	process.	The	valves	2V2	and	2V3	should 	be	equipped 	with	posi-
tion	monitors,	or	–	since	this 	is	not	yet	state	of	the	art	–	they	should	be	checked 	regularly	for	correct	operation.	An	
accumulation	of 	undetected 	faults	can	lead	to	loss	of	the	safety	function.
•	Should	trapped	compressed 	air	pose	a	further	hazard,	additional 	measures	are	required.
Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.
•	The	directional 	control	valve	1V1	features 	a	closed	centre	position	with	sufficient 	overlap	and 	spring-centred 	central	
position.
•	The	stop	valves	2V2	and	2V3	are	ideally 	screwed	into	the	cylinder	and 	driven	by	the	valve	2V1	acting	as 	a	pilot	
valve.
•		The	safety-oriented 	switching	position	is 	assumed	from	any	position	by 	cancellation	of 	the	control 	signal.	
•		A	single-channel 	PLC	for	example	is 	employed	for	the	processing	of 	signals	from	the	pressure	monitor	2S1. 	
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	MTTFD:	B10D	values	of	20,000,000	cycles 	[S]	are	assumed 	for	the	valves	1V1,	2V1,	2V2	and 	2V3.	At	240	working	days,	
16	working	hours 	and	a	cycle	time	of 	20	seconds,	nop	is	691,200	cycles 	per	year.	The	MTTFD	for	1V1,	2V1,	2V2	and 	2V3	
is	thus	289	years.	Capping	of 	the	two	channels 	to	100	years	results	in	a	symmetrized 	MTTFD	value	per	channel 	of	
98 years	(“high”).
•	DCavg:	pressure	monitoring	of 	the	control 	signal	for	the	stop	 valves	results	in	a	DC	of	99%	for	2V1.	Fault 	detection	via	
the	process 	results	in	a	DC	of	60%	for	1V1,	and 	regular	checking	of 	operation	in	a	 DC	of	60%	for	2V2/2V3.	Averaging	
thus	produces	a	DCavg	of	69.8%	(“low”).
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	(85	points):	separation	(15),	diversity 	(20),	overvoltage	protec -
tion	etc.	(15)	and 	environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
The	combination	of 	the	pneumatic 	control	elements	satisfies	Category	3	with	a	high	 MTTFD	(98.2	years)	and	low	DCavg		
(69.8%).	This	results	in	an	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	8.5	·	10-8	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	e.	Following	
the	addition	of 	further	safety-related 	control	components 	in	the	form	of 	subsystems 	for	completion	of 	the	safety	func-
tion,	the	PL 	may	under	certain	circumstances 	be	lower.	\n1948 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Functional description
•	A	hazard	zone	is	safeguarded 	by	two	movable	guards 	(safety	guards).	Opening	of 	a	safety	screen	is	detected	by	two	
position	switches 	B1/B2	respectively 	B3/B4	comprising	break 	contact/make	contact 	combinations 	and	evaluated	
by	a	central	safety	module	K1.	K1	actuates 	two	contactors,	Q1	and 	Q2,	dropping	out 	of	which	interrupts 	or	prevents

•	For	fault	detection	purposes,	all 	position	switch	states 	are	read	by	a	second	contact	into	a	standard 	PLC	K3,	the	
chief	purpose	of 	which	is	functional	control.	In	the	event 	of	a	fault,	K3	can	de-energize	the	contactors 	Q1	and	Q2	
independently 	of	K1	by	means	of	a	contactor	relay 	K2.	Faults	in	K2,	Q1	and 	Q2	are	detected 	by	the	safety	module	K1.	
The	safety	function	is	retained	in	the	event 	of	a	component 	failure.	The	majority 	of	component 	failures	are	detected 	
and	lead	to	operating	inhibition.	An	accumulation	of 	undetected 	faults	does	not	result	in	loss	of	the	safety	func-
tion.	
Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.	Protective	circuits 	
(such	as	contact	protection)	as 	described	in	the	initial 	paragraphs 	of	Chapter	8	are	implemented.
•	A	stable	arrangement 	of	the	guards 	is	assured	for	actuation	of 	the	position	switches.
•	B1	and	B3	are	position	switches 	with	a	direct 	opening	contact 	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-5-1,	Annex 	K.
•	The	supply	conductors 	to	the	position	switches 	are	laid	separately	or	with	protection.
•	Faults	in	the	actuating	and 	operating	mechanism	are	detected 	by	the	use	of	two	position	switches 	differing	in	the	
principle	of 	their	actuation	(break 	and	make	contact 	combination).
•	Several	safeguards 	may	be	cascaded.	Cascading	limits 	the	facility	for	K1	to	detect 	faults	(see	Annex 	E).	The	position	
switches	are	however	additionally 	monitored	by	K3;	this	results	in	faults	being	detected 	even	where	safeguards 	are	
cascaded.
•	The	safety	module	K1	satisfies 	all	requirements 	for	Category 	4	and	PL	e.
•	The	contactor	relay 	K2	possesses 	mechanically 	linked	contact	elements	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-5-1,	Annex 	L.
•	The	contactors 	Q1	and	Q2	possess 	mirror	contacts 	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-4-1,	Annex 	F.
•	The	PLC	K3	satisfies 	the	normative	requirements 	set	out	in	subclause	6.3. 	
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	The	circuit	arrangement 	can	be	divided 	into	three	subsystems 	as	shown	in	the	safety-related 	block	diagram.	The	
probability	of	failure	of	the	safety	module	K1	is 	added	at	the	end	of	the	calculation	(2.3	·	10-9	per	hour	[M],	suitable	
for	PL	e).	For	the	remaining	subsystems,	the	probability 	of	failure	is	calculated	as	follows.	Since	each	guard 	door

•	MTTFD:	for	the	position	switch	B1	with	direct 	opening	action	and 	roller	actuation,	the	B10D	is	20	·	106	switching	cycles 	
[M].	For	position	switch	B2	(make	contact),	the	B10D	is	1	·	105	switching	cycles 	[M].	At	365	working	days,	16	working	
hours	per	day	and	a	cycle	time	of 	1	hour,	the	nop		for	these	components 	is	5,840	cycles 	per	year.	The	MTTFD	of	B1	and	
B2	is	34,246	years	and	171	years	for	B2	respectively.	For	the	contactors 	Q1	and	Q2,	the	B10	value	corresponds 	under	
inductive	load 	(AC	3)	to	an	electrical 	durability	of	1,000,000	switching	cycles 	[M].	On	the	assumption	that 	50%		
of	failures	are	dangerous,	the	B10D	value	is	produced	by	doubling	of 	the	B10	value.	The	value	assumed 	above	for

17.1	years.	Its	replacement 	in	good	time	is	recommended.	
•	DCavg:	the	DC	of	99%	for	B1	and 	B2	is	based	upon	plausibility 	monitoring	of 	the	break/make	contact 	combinations 	
in	K1	and	K3.	The	DC	of	99%	for	the	contactors 	Q1	and	Q2	is	derived	from	monitoring	at 	each	energization	of 	K1.	The

The	subsystems 	B1/B2	and	Q1/Q2	each	correspond 	to	Category 	4	with	a	high	 MTTFD	(100	years)	and	high	 DCavg	
(99%).	This	results	in	an	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	in	each	case	of 	2.3	·	10-9	per	hour.	Following	addi -

Functional description
•	Hazardous	movements 	or	states	are	interrupted 	or	prevented 	by	actuation	of 	an	emergency 	stop	device.	As 	shown	
by	Example	3	in	subclause	5.3.2,	each	emergency 	stop	device	initiates 	a	safety	function	of 	its	own.	S1	is	considered 	
below	as	being	representative	of 	all	the	devices.	 S1	is	evaluated	in	a	safety	module	K1,	which	actuates 	two	redun-
dant	contactor	relays 	K2	and	K3.
•	The	signals 	from	the	emergency 	stop	devices 	are	read	redundantly 	into	the	safety 	module	K1	for	fault 	detection.	
K1	also	features 	internal	test	measures.	 The	contactor	relays 	K2	and	K3	are	also	monitored 	in	K1,	by	means	of	
mechanically 	linked	readback	contacts.	K2	and 	K3	are	switched 	by	the	switch	 S4	at	each	start-up	command,	appro -
ximately	twice	each	month.	An	accumulation	of 	more	than	two	faults 	in	the	period 	between	two	successive	actua -
tions	can	lead	to	loss	of	the	safety	function.
•	It	is	not	assumed	that	more	than	one	emergency 	stop	device	is 	pressed	simultaneously.
•	Organizational 	measures	ensure	that 	each	emergency-stop	device	is 	actuated	at	least	once	a	year.
Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.	Protective	circuits 	
(such	as	contact	protection)	as 	described	in	the	initial 	paragraphs 	of	Chapter	8	are	implemented.
•	The	emergency 	stop	devices 	S1,	S2	and	S3	are	switching	devices 	with	direct	opening	contacts 	in	accordance	with	
IEC	60947-5-1,	Annex 	K.
•	The	supply	conductors 	to	the	switching	devices 	are	laid	with	protection. 	\n2078 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

•	The	safety	module	K1	satisfies 	all	requirements 	for	Category 	4	and	PL	e.
•	K2	and	K3	possess 	mechanically 	linked	contact	elements	to	IEC	60947-5-1,	Annex 	L.
Remark
•	The	emergency 	stop	function	is 	a	complementary 	protective	measure	to	EN	ISO	12100	[3]. 	
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	S1,	S2	and	S3	are	standard 	emergency 	stop	devices 	to	EN	ISO	13850.	In	the	two-channel 	model,	a	B10D	value	of	
100,000	switching	cycles 	[S]	is	substituted 	for	each	contact 	of	an	emergency-stop	device.	 The	probability 	of	failure	
of	the	safety	module	K1	is 	added	at	the	end	of	the	calculation	(2.3	·	10-9	per	hour	[M],	suitable	for	PL 	e).	
•	MTTFD:	for	the	contactor	relays 	K2	and	K3,	the	B10	value	corresponds 	under	inductive	load 	(AC	3)	to	an	electrical 	
durability	of	1,000,000	switching	cycles 	[M].	On	the	assumption	that 	50%	of	failures	are	dangerous,	the	B10D	value	
is	produced	by	doubling	of 	the	B10	value.	With	twelve	demands 	upon	the	emergency 	stop	function	and 	24	start	
commands	per	year,	nop	is	36	cycles	per	year	and	the	MTTFD	is	55,556	years.	This	is	also	the	symmetrized 	MTTFD	for	
the	channel,	which	is 	capped	to	100	years	(“high”).
•	DCavg:	the	DC	for	K2	and	K3	and	for	S1.1	and	S1.2	is	90%.	The	DC	is	based	upon	testing	and 	the	detection	of 	cross-
circuits	by	the	safety	module	K1.	 This	is	also	the	 DCavg	(“medium”).	An	adequate	test 	rate	of	the	emergency-stop	
devices	is	assured	(refer	to	the	information	in	subclauses 	6.2.14	and	D.2.5.1).
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	(70	points):	separation	(15),	well-tried 	components 	(5),	over-
voltage	protection	etc.	(15)	and 	environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	At	twelve	demands 	upon	the	emergency 	stop	function	per	 year,	the	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	 PFHD	
for	the	emergency 	stop	device	 S1	is	4.3	·	10-8	per	hour.
•	The	subsystem	K2/K3	satisfies 	Category	3	with	a	high	 MTTFD	(100	years)	and	medium	 DCavg	(90%).	This	results	in	an	
average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	4.3	·	10-8	per	hour.	Following	addition	of 	the	subsystem	K1,	the	average	
probability	of	dangerous 	failure	is	8.8	·	10-8	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	e.	The	PLr	of	d	is	thus	surpassed. 	\n2088 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

•	Safety-related 	stop	function,	initiated 	by	a	guard:	opening	of 	the	interlocking	device	initiates 	the	safety	function	
STO	(safe	torque	off).
Functional description
•	A	hazard	zone	is	safeguarded 	by	means	of	a	guard,	opening	of 	which	is	detected	by	a	safety	module	K1.	 The	safety	
module	actuates 	a	contactor	Q2	and 	a	combination	comprising	a	contactor	monitoring	module	F1	and 	an	undervol -
tage	release	Q1.	 The	dropping-out 	of	Q2	interrupts 	hazardous	movements 	and	prevents	hazardous	states	from	ari-
sing.	The	contactor	monitoring	module	F1	has 	the	function	of 	monitoring	the	main	contacts 	of	the	contactor	Q2	for	
contact	welding.	Should	Q2	fail	to	drop	out,	F1	trips 	the	upstream	circuit-breaker	or	motor	starter	Q1	 via	the	latter‘s 	
undervoltage	release.	 The	circuit-breaker	or	motor	starter	then	switches 	off	the	motor.
•	The	safety	function	is	preserved	in	the	event 	of	a	component 	failure.
•	An	accumulation	of 	faults	between	two	successive	actuations 	can	lead	to	loss	of	the	safety	function.	\n2118 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Design features
•	The	circuit-breaker	Q1	is 	checked	regularly	by	means	of	a	test	function	that 	is	to	be	implemented 	manually.	The	
interval	between	the	tests 	should	not	exceed	one-hundredth	of 	the	MTTFD	of	Q1;	the	test 	could	be	performed 	for	
example	during	maintenance	of 	the	machine.	 The	contactor	Q2	is 	tested	continually 	by	the	contactor	monitoring	
module.	Loss 	of	the	safety	function	between	the	tests,	as 	is	possible	with	Category 	2,	cannot	occur.	The	single-fault 	
safety	is	thus	assured	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	3	are	met.
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.	Protective	circuits 	
(such	as	contact	protection)	as 	described	in	the	initial 	paragraphs 	of	Chapter	8	are	implemented.
•	For	reasons 	of	simplification,	details 	of	the	safeguard 	have	been	omitted 	from	the	presentation.
•	The	safeguard 	acts	upon	a	safety 	module	K1	that 	satisfies	all	requirements 	for	Category 	3	or	4	and	PL	e.
•	The	auxiliary 	contacts	of	the	contactor	Q2	are	mechanically 	linked	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-5-1,	Annex 	L.
•	Faults	are	analysed 	for	Q2	(with	mirror	contacts)	and 	for	the	internal 	relay	of	the	contactor	monitoring	module	F1	as 	
for	mechanically 	linked	contacts.
Remark
•	Consideration	must 	be	given	to	the	response	time	caused 	by	the	contactor	monitoring	module	F1	with	regard 	to	the	
dropping-out 	of	Q1.	
Calculation of the probability of failure 
•	The	safety	function	permits 	division	into	two	subsystems.	 The	subsystem	consisting	of 	the	safeguard 	and	the	
safety	module	K1	is 	not	considered 	in	this	example.
•	MTTFD:	for	the	contactor	monitoring	module	F1,	the	 MTTFD	is	125	years	at	a	maximum	nop	of	350,400	cycles 	per		
year	[M].	Under	inductive	load 	(AC	3),	the	B10D	value	attained 	for	Q1	is	10,000	switching	cycles 	and	the	B10D	value	
attained	for	Q2	1,300,000	switching	cycles.	 With	assumed 	actuation	daily 	on	365	working	days,	nop	is	365	cycles	
per	year	for	Q1,	and 	the	MTTFD	is	274	years.	At	365	working	days,	16	working	hours 	and	a	cycle	time	of 	1	minute,		
nop	is	350,400	cycles 	per	year	for	Q2,	and 	the	MTTFD	is	37	years.	For	the	channel 	consisting	of 	F1	and	Q1,	this	results	
in	an	 MTTFD	of	85	years.	Overall,	the	resulting	symmetrized 	MTTFD	value	per	channel 	is	64	years	(“high”).
•	DCavg:	the	DC	of	99%	for	Q2	is 	based	upon	testing	by 	means	of	the	contactor	monitoring	module	F1.	A	 DC	of	99%	for	
F1	is	achieved	by	fault-detection	measures 	within	the	contactor	monitoring	module.	 The	circuit-breaker	Q1	is 	tested	
by	means	of	the	manual 	test	function	that 	is	to	be	implemented;	this 	produces	a	DC	of	90%.	A	 DC	of	99%	is	substi-
tuted	for	F1.	Averaging	thus 	yields	a	DCavg	of	98%	(“medium”).
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	(65	points):	separation	(15),	overvoltage	protection	etc.	(15)	and 	
environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	The	subsystem,	comprising	Q1,	Q2	and 	F1,	satisfies 	Category	3	with	a	high	 MTTFD	(64	years)	and	medium	 DCavg	
(98%).	This	results	in	an	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	4.4	·	10-8	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	e.	Following	
addition	of	the	subsystem,	comprising	safeguard 	and	safety	module	K1,	the	PL 	may	under	certain	circumstances 	be	
lower.
•	In	consideration	of 	estimation	erring	on	the	safe	side	as 	described	above,	a	T10D	value	of	3.7	years	is	produced	for	
the	wearing	element 	Q2	for	replacement 	as	specified.	\n2128 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Safety function
•	Safety-related 	stop	function,	initiated 	by	a	safeguard:	stopping	of 	the	hazardous 	movement
Functional description
•	The	hazard	zone	is	safeguarded 	by	means	of	a	movable	guard,	the	position	of 	which	is	detected	by	two	position	
switches	B1	and	B2	in	the	form	of 	a	break	contact/make	contact 	combination.	 The	signals 	are	read	into	a	standard 	
safety	module	K2,	which	is 	looped	into	the	enabling	path	for	the	electrical 	pilot	control	K1	(a	conventional 	PLC)	for	
the	hydraulic 	actuators.	Hazardous 	movements 	or	states	are	controlled 	on	the	actuator	side	by 	three	directional 	
control	valves	(1V3,	1V4	and 	1V5).	In	response	to	a	demand 	of	the	safety	function,	all 	valves	are	de-energized 	elec-
trically	by	K2,	and	are	placed	by	their	return	springs 	in	the	closed 	centre	position	(1V4)	or	closed 	position	(1V3	and 	
1V5).	The	oil	return	from	the	end 	of	the	cylinder	above	the	piston	to	the	reservoir	is 	interrupted 	simultaneously 	by	
the	valves	1V4	and	1V5.	1V5	is	a	poppet	valve	that	is	designed	to	shut	off	the	volumetric	flow	without 	leakage.	Valve	
1V4,	which	also	controls 	the	direction	of 	movement 	of	the	cylinder,	is 	a	piston-type	directional 	control	valve	that	
also	exhibits 	a	certain	degree	of 	leakage	in	the	closed 	centre	position.	Although	the	 valve	1V3	is 	only	indirectly	
involved	in	the	stop	function,	it 	may	have	a	negative	impact 	upon	the	safety 	function.	Should	1V3	and	1V4	stick	at	\n2238 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

the	same	time,	pressure	builds 	up	at	the	end	of	the	cylinder	above	the	piston,	whilst 	the	end	below	it	remains	shut	
off	by	1V5.	Owing	to	the	pressure	ratio	in	the	cylinder,	the	pressure-relief 	valve	1V6	then	opens 	and	the	ram	of	the	
press	drops.
•	Failure	of	one	of	the	valves	does	not	result	in	loss	of	the	safety	function.	All 	valves	are	actuated 	cyclically.
•	Each	valve	is	equipped	with	a	position	monitoring	facility,	1S3,	1S4	and 	1S5,	for	fault 	detection	purposes.	Failure	of 	
any	of	the	three	valves	is	detected	in	the	conventional 	PLC	K1,	which	prevents 	the	next	hazardous	movement 	from	
being	initiated 	following	a	fault.
•	A	single	fault 	in	one	safety 	component 	does	not	result	in	loss	of	the	safety	function.	In	addition,	single	faults 	are	
detected	at	or	prior	to	the	next 	demand.	An	accumulation	of 	undetected 	faults	does	not	result	in	loss	of	the	safety	
function.
Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	observed.	Protective	circuits 	(such	as	
contact	protection)	as 	described	in	the	initial 	paragraphs 	of	Chapter	8	are	implemented.
•	A	stable	arrangement 	of	the	guard	is	assured	for	actuation	of 	the	position	switch.
•	The	switch	B1	is 	a	position	switch	with	a	direct 	opening	contact 	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-5-1,	Annex 	K.
•	The	safety	module	K2	satisfies 	all	requirements 	for	Category 	4	and	PL	e.
•	The	supply	conductors 	to	the	position	switches 	are	laid	separately	or	with	protection.
•	A	standard	PLC	without	safety	functions	is	employed	for	K1.
•	The	valves	1V3,	1V4	and 	1V5	possess 	a	closed	centre	position/closed 	position	with	sufficient 	overlap,	spring-	
centred	central	position/return,	and 	position	monitoring.
•	The	safety-oriented 	switching	position	is 	assumed	from	any	position	by 	cancellation	of 	the	control 	signal.
•	The	pressure-relief 	valve	1V6	for	protecting	the	cylinder	1A	and 	the	components 	below	it	against	the	effect	of	the	
pressure	ratio	satisfies 	the	requirements 	of	EN	693:2001,	subclause	5.2.4.4. 	
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	K2	is	considered 	as	a	subsystem	with	a	probability 	of	failure	of	2.3	·	10-9	per	hour	[M].	 The	remaining	part 	of	the	
control	system	is	grouped	separately	by	electromechanical 	and	hydraulic	components 	to	form	two	Category 	4	sub-
systems,	the	probability 	of	failure	of	which	is	calculated	below.
•	MTTFD:	for	the	position	switch	B1	with	direct 	opening	action,	the	B10D	is	20	·	106	switching	cycles 	[M].	For	the	electri -
cal	make	contact 	of	the	position	switch	B2,	the	B10D		is	1,000,000	switching	cycles 	[M].	At	365	working	days,	16 wor -
king	hours	per	day	and	a	cycle	time	of 	10	minutes,	nop	is	35,040	cycles 	per	year	for	these	components,	and 	the	
MTTFD	is	5,707	years	for	B1	and	285	for	B2.	An	 MTTFD	of	150	years	[M]	is	assumed	for	each	of	the	valves	1V3,	1V4	and 	
1V5.	This	yields	an	MTTFD	value	per	channel 	of	100	and	88	years	(“high”)	respectively 	for	the	two	subsystems. 	\n2248 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	DCavg:	the	DC	of	99%	for	B1	and 	B2	is	based	upon	plausibility 	monitoring	of 	the	two	switching	states 	in	K2.	The	DC	
of	99%	for	the	two	 valves	is	based	upon	direct 	monitoring	of 	the	switching	states 	by	the	PLC	K1.	This	results	in	a	
DCavg	of	99%	(“high”)	for	the	two	subsystems.
•	Measures	against	common	cause	failures 	(75	points)	for	the	two	subsystems:	separation	(15),	well-tried 	compo-
nents	(5),	FMEA	(5),	protection	against 	overvoltage	etc.	(15)	and 	environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	The	electromechanical 	and	hydraulic	parts	of	the	control 	system	correspond 	to	Category 	4	with	a	high	 MTTFD	and	a	
high	DCavg	(99%).	This	results	in	an	average	probabilities 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	1.3	·	10-9	per	hour	and 	2.1	·	10-8	per	
hour.	Addition	inclusive	of	K2	produces	an	average	probability	of	dangerous	failure	for	the	complete	safety	function	
of	2.5	·	10-8	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	e.

Safety function
•	Safety-related 	stop	function,	initiated 	by	a	movable	guard:	opening	of 	the	movable	guard 	(safety	guard)	initiates 	
the	safety	function	STO	(safe	torque	off).
Functional description
•	A	hazard	zone	is	safeguarded 	by	a	movable	guard 	(safety	guard).	Opening	of 	the	safety	guard	is	detected	by	two	
position	switches 	B1/B2	employing	a	break 	contact	element/make	contact 	element	combination,	and 	evaluated	
in	a	central	safety	module	K1.	K1	actuates 	two	contactors,	Q1	and 	Q2,	dropping	out 	of	which	interrupts 	or	prevents 	
hazardous	movements 	or	states.
•	The	position	switches 	are	monitored 	for	plausibility 	in	K1	for	the	purpose	of 	fault	detection.	Faults 	in	Q1	and	Q2	are	
detected	by	a	start-up	test 	in	K1.	A	start 	command	is	successful	only	if	Q1	and	Q2	had	previously	dropped	out.	Start-
up	testing	by 	opening	and 	closing	of	the	guard	is	not	required.	\n2278 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

•	The	safety	function	remains 	intact	in	the	event 	of	a	component 	failure.	Faults 	are	detected 	during	operation	or	at 	
actuation	(opening	and 	closing)	of	the	guard	by	the	dropping	out 	of	Q1	and	Q2	and	operating	inhibition.
•	An	accumulation	of 	more	than	two	faults 	in	the	period 	between	two	successive	actuations 	can	lead	to	loss	of	the	
safety	function.	
Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.	Protective	circuits 	
(such	as	contact	protection)	as 	described	in	the	initial 	paragraphs 	of	chapter	8	are	implemented.
•	A	stable	arrangement 	of	the	guards 	is	assured	for	actuation	of 	the	position	switches.
•	The	switch	B1	is 	a	position	switch	with	direct 	opening	action	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-5-1,	Annex 	K.
•	The	supply	conductors 	to	position	switches 	B1	and	B2	are	laid 	separately	or	with	protection.
•	The	safety	module	K1	satisfies 	all	requirements 	for	Category 	4	and	PL	e.
•	The	contactors 	Q1	and	Q2	possess 	mirror	contacts 	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-4-1,	Annex 	F.
Remarks
•	Category	4	is	not	observed	if	several	mechanical 	position	switches 	for	different 	guards	are	cascaded 	(connected 	in	
a	series	arrangement),	since	this 	limits	fault	detection	in	the	switches 	(see	Annex 	E).	
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	The	circuit	arrangement 	can	be	divided 	into	three	subsystems 	as	shown	in	the	safety-related 	block	diagram.	The	
probability	of	failure	of	the	standard 	safety	module	K1	is 	added	at	the	end	of	the	calculation	(2.3	·	10-9	per	hour	[M],	
suitable	for	PL 	e).	For	the	remaining	subsystems,	the	probability 	of	failure	is	calculated	as	follows.
•	MTTFD:	for	the	position	switch	B1	with	roller	actuation,	the	B10D	is	20	·	106	operation	cycles 	[M].	For	the	position	
switch	B2	(make	contact 	element),	the	B10D	is	1	·	105	operation	cycles 	[M].	At	365	working	days,	16	working	hours 	
per	day	and	a	cycle	time	of 	1	hour,	nop	for	these	components 	is	5,840	cycles 	per	year	and	the	MTTFD	is	1,674	years	
for	B1	and	B2.	For	the	contactors 	Q1	and	Q2,	the	B10	value	corresponds 	under	inductive	load 	(AC	3)	to	an	electrical 	
dura	bility	of	1,000,000	operation	cycles 	[M].	On	the	assumption	that 	50%	of	failures	are	dangerous,	the	B10D	value	
is	produced	by	doubling	of 	the	B10	value.	The	value	assumed 	above	for	nop	results	in	an	 MTTFD	of	3,424	years	per	
	channel	for	Q1	and	Q2.	The	position	switch	B2	exhibits 	a	limited	operation	time	of 	17.1	years.	Its	replacement 	in	
good	time	is	recommended.
•	DCavg:	the	DC	of	99%	for	B1	and 	B2	is	based	upon	plausibility 	monitoring	of 	the	break/make	contact 	element	combi-
nations	in	K1.	The	DC	of	99%	for	contactors 	Q1	and	Q2	is	derived	from	regular	monitoring	by 	K1	during	start-up.	 The	
DC	values	stated	correspond 	to	the	 DCavg	for	the	subsystem	concerned.
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	in	the	subsystems 	B1/B2	and	Q1/Q2	(70	points):	separation	
(15),	well-tried 	components 	(5),	protection	against 	overvoltage	etc.	(15)	and 	environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	The	subsystems 	B1/B2	and	Q1/Q2	each	satisfy 	Category	4	with	a	high	 MTTFD	and	high	 DCavg	(99%).	This	results	in	
an	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	2.3	·	10–9	per	hour	for	each	subsystem.	Following	addition	of 	the	sub-
system	K1,	the	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	is	4.6	·	10-9	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	e.	\n2288 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

one	of	the	two	pushbuttons 	S1/S2	is	released,	enabling	is 	cancelled	and	remains	blocked	until	both	pushbuttons 	
are	released 	and	pressed	again	synchronously.
Functional description
•	The	logic	unit	K1	monitors 	operation	of 	the	actuators 	(pushbuttons)	 S1	and	S2.	Only	when	both	pushbuttons 	are	
operated	synchronously 	(i.e.	within	a	maximum	time	of 	500	ms	as	specified	in	EN	574)	from	within	the	released 	
state	do	the	contactor	relays 	K2	and	K3	pick	up,	resulting	in	enabling.	 When	at	least	one	of	the	pushbuttons 	S1/S2	
is	released,	K2/K3	cancel 	enabling.
•	K2	and	K3	have	the	function	of 	contact	multiplication/load 	adaptation.	 The	actual	prevention	of 	the	hazardous 	
movement,	for	example	by 	separation	of 	the	electrical 	or	hydraulic 	energy,	is	dependent 	upon	the	application	and 	
is	not	shown	here.
•	Faults	in	the	actuating	mechanism	are	detected 	in	S1/S2	to	the	greatest 	extent	possible	by 	the	use	of	two	con-
tacts employing	different 	principles	(break	and	make	contact 	combination).	In	accordance	with	Recommendation	
for	Use	(RfU)	CNB/M/11.033/R/E 	Rev	06,	mechanical 	faults	on	the	actuators 	can	be	excluded 	when	they	satisfy

•	Faults	in	S1/S2	and	in	K2/K3	(with	break 	contacts	in	the	feedback 	circuit)	are	detected 	in	K1	and	lead	to	sustained 	
de-energization	 via	K2	and	K3.	All	individual	faults	are	detected 	at	or	prior	to	the	next 	demand	of	the	safety	func-
tion.
•	Frequent	actuation	of 	the	electromechanical 	elements	results	in	a	sufficiently 	high	test	rate	(forced 	dynamics).
Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.	Protective	circuits 	
(such	as	contact	protection),	as 	described	in	subclause	8.1,	are	implemented.
•	The	actuators 	S1	and	S2	of	the	two-hand 	control	satisfy	IEC	60947-5-1.	In	accordance	with	RfU	CNB/M/11.033/R/E 	
Rev	06,	mechanical 	faults	can	therefore	be	excluded.
•	Faults	in	the	conductors 	to	S1	and	S2	are	detected 	in	the	logic 	device.	If	this	were	not	possible,	the	conditions 	to	
EN	ISO	13849-2,	 Table	D.4	for	a	fault 	exclusion	for	conductor	short 	circuits	would	have	to	be	observed.	Owing	to	the	
low	currents,	pushbuttons 	with	gold-plated 	contacts	are	recommended.
•	Refer	to	EN	574,	subclauses 	8	and	9	with	regard 	to	fitting	of 	the	pushbuttons 	and	measures	for	the	avoidance	of 	
accidental	actuation	and 	defeating.	 The	safety	distance	from	the	hazard 	zone	must	be	sufficiently 	great.
•	The	logic	unit	K1	satisfies 	Type	III	C	to	EN	574,	with	self-monitoring	and 	detection	of 	internal	faults.	K1	is 	a	tested	
safety	component 	for	use	in	Category 	4	and	PL	e.
•	The	contactor	relays 	K2	and	K3	possess 	mechanically 	linked	break	contacts	in	accordance	with	IEC 	60947-5-1,	
Annex	L	for	feedback.
Remarks
•	The	example	shown	is 	suitable	for	application	for	example	on	mechanical 	presses	(EN	692).	
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	K1	is	considered 	as	a	subsystem	with	a	probability 	of	failure	of	3.0	·	10-9	per	hour	[M].	 The	remaining	part 	of	the	
control	system	is	grouped	to	form	a	Category 	4	subsystem	the	probability 	of	failure	of	which	is	calculated	below.
•	Since	S1	and	S2	must	initiate	de-energization	independently 	of	each	other	when	released,	they 	are	connected 	
logically	in	series.	For	this 	purpose,	one	make	contact 	13-14	and	one	break	contact	21-22	were	each	assigned 	to	a	
control	channel.	The	safety-related 	block	diagram	differs 	substantially 	in	this	respect	from	the	functional 	circuit	
diagram.	If	the	reliability 	data	are	available	only 	for	the	pushbuttons 	as	a	whole	(actuation	mechanism	and 	break	
and	make	contacts),	the	failure	 values	for	the	pushbuttons 	may	be	employed 	as	an	estimation	erring	on	the	safe	
side	for	the	failure	 values	for	the	contacts 	(plus	operating	mechanism).
•	MTTFD:	owing	to	the	defined 	control	current	generated	by	K1	(low	electrical 	load;	the	mechanical 	durability	of	the	
contacts	is	the	determining	factor),	B10D	values	of	2,000,000	switching	cycles 	[M]	are	assumed 	in	each	case	for	
S1	and	S2.	At	240	working	days,	8	working	hours 	and	a	cycle	time	of 	30	seconds,	nop	is	230,400	cycles 	per	year	
for	these	components,	and 	the	MTTFD	is	86.8	years	per	contact.	 Since	K2	and 	K3	also	switch	control 	currents,	
B10D	values	of	20,000,000	cycles 	[S]		and	resulting	 MTTFD	values	of	868	years	apply	to	each	of	them.	Should	the	
re	quirements 	be	higher	(longer	working	hours 	or	a	shorter	cycle	time),	higher	B10D	values	validated	by	the	manu-
facturer	may 	be	required 	for	K2/K3.	Overall,	the	resulting	 MTTFD	value	per	channel 	is	41	years	(“high”).	\n2328 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	DCavg:	a	DC	of	99%	for	S1	and	S2	is	achieved	by	virtue	of	direct	monitoring	with	the	aid 	of	the	break/make	contact 	
combinations 	in	K1.	The	DC	of	99%	for	K2	and 	K3	is	based	upon	readback 	of	the	mechanically 	linked	break	contacts	
in	the	feedback 	circuit	of	K1.	The	high	frequency 	of	actuation	in	the	application	results 	in	frequent 	testing	(see	sub -
clause	6.2.14).	Averaging	results 	in	a	DCavg	of	99%	(“high”).
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	(70	points):	separation	(15),	FMEA	(5),	overvoltage	protection	
etc.	(15)	and 	environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	The	combination	of 	the	control 	elements	satisfies	Category	4	with	a	high	 MTTFD	per	channel 	(41	years)	and	high	
DCavg	(99%).	For	the	combination	of 	S1,	S2,	K2	and	K3,	the	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	is	calculated	at	
6.7	·	10-8	per	hour.	If 	a	value	of	3.0	·	10-9	per	hour	[E]	for	K1	is 	added,	the	result 	is	an	average	probability 	of	dange-
rous	failure	of	7.0	·	10-8	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	e.	The	probability 	of	failure	of	downstream	power	components 	
may	have	to	be	added 	for	completion	of 	the	safety	function.
•	The	wearing	elements 	S1	and	S2	should	each	be	replaced 	at	intervals	of	approximately 	eight	years	(T10D).

Safety function
•	Controlled	location	of 	a	single	operator‘s 	hands	outside	the	hazard 	zone	during	the	press 	and	cutting	movement:	
when	at	least	one	of	the	two	pushbuttons 	S1/S2	is	released,	enabling	is 	cancelled	and	remains	blocked	until	both	
pushbuttons 	are	released 	and	pressed	again	synchronously.
Functional description
•	Actuation	of 	the	two-hand 	control	(THC)	S1	and	S2	initiates 	the	hazardous 	movements 	(processing	cycle)	of 	the	
clamping	bar	(hydraulic)	1A	and 	of	the	knife	(electromechanical).	If,	during	this 	cycle,	either	of 	the	pushbuttons 	S1	
or	S2	is	released	or	a	signal	change	occurs 	in	the	peripheral 	system	of	the	machine	(e.g.	light 	curtain,	not 	shown	
on	the	diagram)	that 	is	not	expected	by	the	control 	system,	the	cycle	is 	stopped	and	the	machine	remains 	in	this	
safe	state.	Owing	to	their	immediate	physical 	proximity	to	each	other,	the	knife	and 	the	clamping	bar	constitute	a	
common	hazard 	zone.	The	hazard	occurs	cyclically.	The	knife	is 	driven	by	an	eccentric 	drive	that	draws	its	energy	
from	a	flywheel 	mass	in	constant 	motion.	The	drive	is 	not	shown	explicitly.	 The	clamping	bar	is 	driven	linearly 	by	a	
hydraulic	arrangement 	employing	a	pump	connected 	to	the	drive	of 	the	flywheel 	mass.
•	When	pushbuttons 	S1/S2	(THC)	are	pushed,	the	signal 	change	is	communicated 	to	the	two	microcontrollers 	K1	
and	K2.	Provided 	these	signals 	satisfy	the	requirements 	for	simultaneity 	in	accordance	with	the	standard 	(EN 574,	
Type	III	C)	and 	all	peripheral	signals	satisfy	the	condition	for	a	start,	K1	and 	K2	set	the	outputs 	for	a	valid	cut	
request.	Each	microcontroller	monitors 	both	hazardous 	movements 	through	the	contactor	relays 	K3	to	K6.	The	
closing	movement 	of	the	clamping	bar	1A	can	be	prevented 	by	the	two	hydraulic 	valves	2V1	and	2V2.	Actuation	of 	
the	brake/clutch	combination	(BCC)	Q1	can	be	prevented 	via	K3	and	K5.	A	suitably 	dimensioned 	mechanical 	knife	
locking	device	Q2	must 	also	be	enabled 	cyclically	by	K2.	Should	faults	be	detected 	in	Q1,	the	knife	cycle	can	there -
fore	be	prevented 	in	the	following	cycle	at 	the	latest.
•	Faults	in	the	switches 	S1/S2	or	in	the	contactor	relays 	with	mechanically 	linked	readback	contacts	K3	to	K6	are	
detected	in	the	microcontrollers 	by	cross	monitoring.	 The	functioning	of 	2V1/2V2	is 	monitored	by	means	of	the	
pressure	switch	2S1.	 Since	the	microcontrollers 	perform	self-tests 	in	addition	in	the	background 	during	operation,	
internal	faults	and	faults	in	the	peripherals 	can	be	detected 	here	in	time. 	
•	All	machine	states 	are	monitored 	and	controlled	by	both	microcontrollers.	 The	cyclical 	nature	of	the	cut	operation	
causes	all	system	states 	to	be	cycled 	through	and 	compared	with	each	other.	Faults 	and	deviations	from	defined 	
intermediate	states 	cause	the	machine	to	be	halted 	at	the	latest	upon	completion	of 	the	cycle.	This	method	is	
implied	in	the	diagram	by 	the	signal	“Feedback 	knife”	B1	and 	the	signal	“Position	monitoring”	B2/B3	of 	the	“Knife	
locking	device”	Q2.
•	Brake	wear	is 	monitored	with	the	aid 	of	the	position	switch	B1.	B1	is 	actuated	and	a	further	cut 	prevented	by	the	
control	system	in	response	to	the	slightest 	increase	in	the	overrun. 	
Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.	Protective	circuits 	
as	described	in	the	initial 	paragraphs 	of	Chapter	8	are	implemented.
•	The	actuators 	S1	and	S2	of	the	two-hand 	control	satisfy	IEC	60947-5-1.	\n2388 Circuit examples for SRP/CS
•	B1	and	B2	are	position	switches 	with	direct	opening	action	to	IEC 	60947-5-1,	Annex 	K.
•	K3	to	K6	possess 	mechanically 	linked	contact	elements	to	IEC	60947-5-1,	Annex 	L.
•	The	supply	conductors 	to	the	position	switches 	are	laid	either	separately 	or	with	protection	against 	mechanical 	
damage.
•	The	software	of 	the	homogeneously 	redundant	microprocessor	structure	satisfies 	the	requirements 	of	IEC	61508-3,	
clause	7	for	 SIL	3.
•	A	fault	exclusion	applies 	for	the	fault:	“complete	failure	of 	the	brake/clutch	combination”,	i.e.	failure	to	disengage	
when	the	cut 	enable	is	cancelled	following	initiation	of 	a	cut.	The	reasoning	for	this 	fault	exclusion	is 	based	upon	
many	years	of	experience	and 	the	design	features 	of	the	brake/clutch	combination	with	the	possibility 	of	early	
detection	of 	brake	wear.
•	The	components 	B1	and	B2/B3	are	required 	for	implementation	of 	the	measures 	required	in	EN	1010-3	for	stopping	
and	overrun	of	the	knife.	
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	The	designated 	architecture	for	Category 	4	for	actuation	of 	the	knife	drive	and 	the	clamping	bar	is 	implemented 	
by	two	independent 	channels	as	described.	 Since	the	channels 	are	virtually	identical	in	their	arrangement 	and	are	
analysed	with	the	use	of 	identical	numerical	data,	symmetrization	is 	not	required.	For	the	sake	of 	simplification,	
only	single-channel 	actuation	of 	Q1	is	assumed.	The	probability 	of	failure	is	therefore	slightly 	lower	in	practice	than	
that	calculated.
•	Since	S1	and	S2	must	initiate	de-energization	independently 	of	each	other	when	released,	they 	are	connected 	
logically	in	series.	For	this 	purpose,	one	make-contact 	13-14	and	one	break-contact 	21-22	were	each	assigned 	to	
a	control	channel.	The	safety-related 	block	diagram	differs 	substantially 	in	this	respect	from	the	functional 	circuit	
diagram.	The	B10D	value	for	each	individual 	contact	is	employed,	constituting	an	estimation	erring	on	the	safe	side.
•	MTTFD:	at	240	working	days,	8	working	hours 	and	a	cycle	time	of 	60	seconds,	nop	is	115,200	switching	cycles 	per	
year.	Owing	to	many 	years‘	experience	gained 	in	the	construction	of 	these	machines,	together	with	relevant 	quality	
records	and	design	measures 	such	as	the	defined 	control	current	(low	electrical 	load;	the	mechanical 	durability	of	
the	contacts 	is	the	determining	factor),	B10D	values	of	2,000,000	switching	cycles 	[E]	each	are	assumed 	for	S1	and	
for	S2,	and	thus	an	MTTFD	of	173	years.	An	 MTTFD	of	878	years	[D]	is	stated	for	the	microcontrollers 	including	peri -
pherals,	in	accordance	with	 SN	29500-2.	At 	low	load,	a	B10D	of	20,000,000	switching	cycles 	[S]	and	thus	an	MTTFD	
of	1,736	years	applies	for	the	contactor	relays 	K3	to	K6.	The	MTTFD	value	of	607	years	for	the	brake/clutch	combi -
nation	Q1	is 	calculated	from	the	B10D	value	of	7,000,000	cycles 	[E].	The	same	value	is	assumed	for	the	knife	locking	
device	Q2	in	the	second 	channel.	The	values	for	the	two	directional 	control	valves	2V1	and	2V2	are	150	 years	[S].	
These	values	result	in	an	 MTTFD	one	of	each	channel 	of	45.2	years	(“high”).
•	DCavg:	the	DC	of	99%	for	S1/S2	is	based	upon	the	cross 	monitoring	of 	input	signals	without	dynamic	test,	with	fre -
quent	signal	changes.	The	DC	of	90%	for	K1/K2	is 	derived	from	self-tests 	performed	by	software	and 	the	dynamic 	
cross	monitoring	of 	data	with	expectations 	regarding	timing.	 The	DC	of	99%	for	K3	to	K6	is 	derived	from	plausibility 	
testing	by	means	of	mechanically 	linked	contacts.	For	2V1/2V2,	the	 DC	is	99%	owing	to	indirect 	and	direct	electrical	
monitoring	of 	the	pressure	with	frequent 	signal	changes.	Wear	in	the	clutch	leads 	to	a	change	in	cutting	behaviour.	
This	behaviour	is 	monitored	by	instruments.	A	 DC	of	99%	is	therefore	assumed 	for	Q1.	Failure	of 	Q2	is	detected	
immediately 	owing	to	cyclical 	actuation	and 	the	monitoring	elements 	B1	and	B3.	This	is	the	reasoning	for	a	 DC	of	
99%.	These	values	result	in	a	DCavg	of	98.5%	(within	the	tolerance	for	“high”).
•	Adequate	measures 	against	common	cause	failure	(65	points):	separation	(15),	overvoltage	protection	etc.	(15)	and 	
environmental 	conditions 	(25	+	10)
•	For	Category 	4,	the	average	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	is	6.5	·	10-8	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	e.
•	With	allowance	for	the	estimation	erring	on	the	safe	side	described 	above,	a	value	of	over	17	years	(T10D)	is	pro-
duced	for	the	specified 	replacement 	of	the	wearing	elements 	S1	and	S2.	\n2398 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Safety functions
•	Safety-related 	stop	function:	stopping	of 	the	hazardous 	movement 	and	prevention	of 	unexpected 	start-up	from	the	
rest	position
•	Only	the	hydraulic 	part	of	the	control 	system	is	shown	in	this 	example,	in	the	form	of 	a	subsystem.	Further	 	
SRP/CS	(e.g.	safeguards 	and	electrical	logic	elements)	must 	be	added	in	the	form	of 	subsystems 	for	completion	 	
of	the	safety	function.
Functional description
•	Hazardous	movements 	are	executed 	by	four	actuators,	1A	to	4A.	 The	movements 	are	halted	by	the	directional 	con-
trol	valve	1V3	in	conjunction	with	the	pilot-operated 	non-return	 valves.	Both	the	former	and 	the	latter	constitute	
well-tried	components 	for	safety	applications.
•	Failure	of	the	directional 	control	valve	or	one	of 	the	pilot-operated 	non-return	 valves	can	result	in	loss	of	the	safety	
function.	The	failure	is 	dependent 	upon	the	reliability 	of	the	valves.
•	No	measures 	for	fault	detection	are	implemented. 	\n2418 Circuit examples for SRP/CS

Design features
•	Basic	and	well-tried	safety	principles	are	observed 	and	the	requirements 	of	Category	B	are	met.
•	1V3	is	a	directional 	control	valve	with	sufficient 	overlap,	spring-centred 	central	position	and 	fatigue-resistant 	
springs.
•	The	valves	1V4,	1V5,	2V1,	2V2,	3V1,	3V2,	4V1	and 	4V2	are	pilot-operated 	non-return	 valves.
•	The	safety-oriented 	switching	position	is 	attained	by	cancellation	of 	the	control 	signal.
•	Where	necessary,	the	manufacturer/user	must 	confirm	that 	the	directional 	control	valve	and	the	pilot-operated 	
non-return	valves	constitute	well-tried 	components 	for	safety	applications.
•	The	following	specific 	measures	are	implemented 	to	increase	the	reliability 	of	the	valves:	a	pressure	filter	1Z3	
upstream	of 	the	directional 	control	valve,	and	suitable	measures 	on	the	cylinder	to	prevent 	dirt	from	being	drawn	in	
by	the	piston	rod 	(e.g.	an	effective	wiper	on	the	piston	rods,	see	*	in	Figure	8.72). 	
Calculation of the probability of failure
•	MTTFD:	an	MTTFD	of	600	years	is	assumed	[S]	in	each	case	for	the	directional 	control	valve	and	the	pilot-operated 	
non-return	valves,	since	the	number	of 	switching	cycles 	of	the	valves	lies	between	250,000	and 	500,000	per	 year	
(nop)	for	this	application.
•	DCavg	and	measures	against	common	cause	failures 	are	not	relevant	in	Category 	1.
•	The	hydraulic 	part	of	the	control 	system	satisfies 	Category	1	with	a	high	 MTTFD	(66.7	years).	This	results	in	an	ave-
rage	probability 	of	dangerous 	failure	of	1.7	·	10-6	per	hour.	This	satisfies	PL	c.

Examples of risk assessment
Changes with respect to the second edition  
(BGIA Report 2/2008e):
• Definition of the safety function extended
• Estimation of the frequency and duration of exposure described in more detail
• Consideration of the incidence and severity of acci-dents extended
 Example 1: Closing edge protection
Figure A.1 shows the risk assessment for the safety func -
tion
• SF1 – Stopping of the closing movement and reversing 
upon detection of an obstacle
of a closing edge protection device1. The movement of 
powered windows, doors and gates (see Figure A.1) is generally associated with the formation of crushing and shearing points. These hazard zones generally exist only when the moving wing is approaching its final positions. Injury to persons in such hazard zones can be avoided, for example by the use of closing edge protection devices. Closing edge protection devices, such as pressure-sensi-tive edges, are fitted to the closing edges of the moving wings. When an obstacle is detected, the closing move-ment is interrupted and a reverse movement is initiated.
Crush and shear points on powered windows, doors and 
gates may cause severe and, under some circumstances, fatal injury. A severity of injury of S2 must therefore be assumed. Persons are infrequently (frequency lower than once every fifteen minutes) and only briefly (total duration of exposure less than 1/20 of the entire operation time) 
present in the area of the crushing and shearing points 
(F1). Under normal circumstances, persons at risk are able 
to move out of the hazard zone formed by the moving wing (P1). This yields a required Pe Level PL
r of c. This 
result is confirmed by the EN 12453 product standard. The 
standards committee evidently saw no reason to deviate 
from this owing to the incidence and severity of accidents. 
Example 13 in [1] shows how this safety function can be achieved. 
1 In the past, closing edge protection devices were governed by the 
Construction Products Directive. Since the pressure-sensitive edges use 
constitute safety components under the Machinery Directive, however, closing edge protection devices are also evaluated in accordance with this directive.On fast-moving gates it is virtually impossible for persons 
to move out of the danger zone in time. The assessment of P2 instead of P1 thus yields a required Performance Level PL
r of d for these products.

Example 2: Autonomous transport vehicles
On autonomous transport vehicle, collision protection is 
assured by the safety function
• SF1 – Stopping of the transport  vehicle upon approa-
ching an obstacle
Since an autonomous transport vehicle may, under cer -
tain circumstances, be carrying a load weighing in the 
order of tons, severe irreversible injury is probable should 
a collision occur with the vehicle travelling at full speed 
(S2). The paths travelled by the vehicle are freely acces-
sible to persons; the presence of a person in the danger \n248Annex A
zone must therefore be assumed to be relatively frequent 
(frequency greater than once every 15 minutes) (F2). 
Since the vehicle travels at a very low speed (generally 3 
to 5 km/h), a pedestrian is generally able to take evasive 
action when such a vehicle approaches (P1). This there -
fore results in a required Performance Level PLr of d for SF1 
(see Figure A.2). This result is confirmed by the EN 1525 
product standard. The standards committee evidently saw 
no reason to deviate from this owing to the incidence and 
severity of accidents.

Example 3: Weaving machine
Weaving machines are employed for the fully automatic 
weaving of textiles. The essential hazard is that of cru-
shing between the reed and the temple. In order to recon -
nect the ends of broken warp threads, the operator must 
intervene in the hazard zone with the machine stationary. 
Unexpected restarting is prevented by the safety function• SF1 – In the event of intervention in the hazard zone: 
prevention of unexpected start-up by safe torque off 
(STO) of all drives
Should the machine restart, the operator‘s fingers may be 
crushed or broken (S2). The frequency of exposure to the 
hazard can be described as low (less frequently than once 
every 15 minutes); the entire exposure duration is lower 
than 1/20 of the entire operation time (F1). Should the 
operator already have his or her hands in the hazard zone 
when the machine restarts unexpectedly, the movement 
is so fast as to make evasion virtually impossible (P2). 
This therefore results in a required Performance Level PLr 
of d for SF1 (see Figure A.3). This result is confirmed by the 
EN ISO 11111-6 product standard. The standards commit -
tee evidently saw no reason to deviate from this owing to 
the incidence and severity of accidents.

Example 4: Rotary printing press
In a web-fed rotary printing press, a paper web is fed 
through a number of cylinders. High operating speeds 
and rotational speeds of the cylinders are reached, parti -
cularly in newspaper printing. Essential hazards exist at 
the entrapment points of the counter-rotating cylinders. 
This example considers the hazard zone on a printing 
press on which maintenance work requires manual inter -
vention at reduced machine speeds. The access to the 
entrapment point is protected by a guard door (safeguar -
ding). The following safety functions are implemented:
• SF1 – Opening of the guard door during operation 
 causes the cylinders to be braked to a halt.
• SF2 – When the guard door is open, any machine move -
ments must be performed at limited speed.
• SF3 – When the guard door is open, movements are 
possible only whilst an inching button is pressed.
Entrapment between the cylinders causes severe injuries 
(S2). Since tasks are performed in the hazard zone only 
during maintenance work, the frequency of exposure to 
the hazard can be described as low (less frequently than 
once every 15 minutes); the entire exposure duration 
is lower than 1/20 of the entire operation time (F1). At 
production speeds, no possibility exists of avoiding the 
hazard (P2). This therefore results in a required Perfor -
mance Level PLr of d for the safety functions SF1 and SF2 
(see Figure A.4). The safety function SF3 can however be 
used only if the printing press has first been halted (SF1) 
and the permissible rotational speed of the cylinders 
limited (SF2). This results in the possible machine move -
ments being predictable for the operator, who is thus able 
to evade hazardous movements (P1). A required Perfor -
mance Level PLr of c is therefore adequate for SF3 (see 
Figure A.4). In deviation from application of the risk graph, 
the EN 1010-1:2010 product standard applicable for this 
machine specifies a PLr of d for the SF3 safety function. 
The risk reduction by SF1 and SF2 was unfortunately not 
considered by this standard. 
Chapter 8, Example 24 describes how the safety functions 
described here can be implemented.Figure A.4:

\n251Annex B:  
Safety-related block diagram and FMEA
 
Changes with respect to the second edition  (BGIA Report 2/2008e):
• Convention for the expression of PFHD (formerly: PFH ), 
MTTFD , λS, λD, λDD, λDU, B10D, T10D adapted to the new ver -
sion of the standard (with the index in capitals)
• Explanations of the use of failure type distributions added
• Explanations added concerning the issue of obtaining B
10D from B10
• “Reference” subclause updated
For demonstration of the Category and Performance Level 
(PL) to EN ISO 13849-1, the structure of a safety-related 
system must be analysed with respect to the safety func -
tion to be implemented (possibly involving separate ana -
lysis of several functions). For the obligatory quantitative 
demonstration of the PL, system information must be 
suitably prepared to permit calculation of the quantitative 
value PFHD (probability of a dangerous failure per hour), or 
direct calculation of the PL based upon it. Two important 
steps in this process are the safety-related block diagram 
and the failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) per -
formed for each block 2.
B.1  Purpose and generation of a  
safety-related block diagram
The result of the safety-oriented analysis of the system 
structure is presented conveniently in the form of a block 
diagram, which can be described as a “safety-related 
block diagram”. The diagram is intended to show whether 
the safety function is executed in whole or part by a sin -
gle-channel or multi-channel solution, and the available 
diagnostics by which internal component failures can be 
detected. Since – with regard to the aspect of relevance 
here, i.e. quantification of the probabilities of failure – 
diagnostics represents a means of compensating for com -
ponent failures, the term “failure detection” will be used 
in this Annex in place of the usual term “fault detection”.
In the field of machine safety, it is generally accepted 
that in the event of a control-system failure, a substitute 
response should occur in place of the safety function 
originally implemented, and that the substitute reaction 
2 The FMEA described here also considers the detection of fai -
lures (diagnostics), and can therefore also be termed FMEDA 
(failure mode, effects and diagnostic analysis).should initiate a safe state, such as operating inhibi -
tion with de-energized outputs (shut-down system). In 
accordance with EN ISO 13849-1, the Category and PL are 
intended to indicate only the safety quality, and not the 
probability of fault-free operation, i.e. the “availability”. 
For this reason, signal paths that initiate a safe state in 
the event of a fault are regarded as being fully equiva -
lent to functional units that may perform complex safety 
functions. A “single safety signal path” in this context is 
however a “channel” in its own right only when it is con -
tinually engaged. If the safety path cannot become active 
until a failure in the main function path proper has been 
detected, its safety benefit is dependent upon the quality 
of the failure detection mechanism. This quality is descri -
bed by the diagnostic coverage of the failure detection 
mechanism. In such cases, the safety path generally pro -
vides only test equipment with shut-off path. Architectural 
features of this kind must be expressed correctly on the 
safety-related block diagram. The differentiated presenta -
tion of a true two-channel arrangement and a monitored 
single channel can be seen clearly from a comparison of 
Figures 10 and 11 in the standard.
Consideration must also be given to whether components 
or circuit elements are present which, although they do 
not execute the safety function or the safety-related sub -
stitute function in the event of a fault, may be able to pre -
vent other components from properly executing the safety 
or substitute function should certain component failures 
occur. Such circuit components include those providing 
necessary auxiliary functions such as the power supply 
or control functions that are not (intentionally) relevant to 
safety but that may have an impact upon safety-related 
parts. Where components and parts of circuits may 
impact negatively upon the safety function, its substitute 
function, or diagnostics functions in the event of failures, 
they must always be considered in a function block. For 
example, components for assurance of electromagnetic 
compatibility (EMC) must be examined with regard to 
whether their failure, for example short-circuiting of a 
capacitor, has negative effects upon safety-related cir -
cuits.
Parts of circuits with defined inputs and outputs may 
be regarded as a function block. In order to keep the 
number of required function blocks as low as possible, 
parts of circuits that are arranged functionally in series, 
i.e. circuits that execute different signal processing steps 
sequentially, can be grouped to form a function block. 
Blocks differing from this arrangement should logically 
be grouped only to the extent that redundancies such as 
separate shut-off paths and the mutual diagnostics of \n252
252Annex B
function blocks are still expressed. The circuit analysis 
must ultimately produce a block diagram in which all the 
structures that are of relevance to safety are reflected:
• Single or parallel signal paths (“channels”) that are 
used to execute the safety function
• Signal paths that execute a safety-related substitute 
function in the event of a fault
• Circuits for the detection of failures (diagnostics)
Where auxiliary circuits that are required for performance 
of the safety function or for some other safety-related 
action (e.g. power supplies, oscillators) are able to influ -
ence one channel only, they should be grouped with 
the function block(s) of the channel concerned. Should 
these auxiliary circuits act upon several channels, they 
form a separate single-channel part (function block) on 
the safety-related block diagram. The same principle 
applies to circuits that are able to prevent performance 
of the safety function, another safety-related action or 
diagnostics owing to a particular manner of their failure. 
Examples include circuits for selection of a safe operating mode, or certain components for the assurance of EMC. 
The content of each function block must be determined 
unambiguously by circuit diagrams and parts lists. Owing 
to the way in which it is created and its particular func -
tion, the safety-related block diagram differs generally 
from block diagrams serving other purposes, such as 
those geared to the mechanical structure of assemblies.
Figure B.1 shows, by way of example, the safety-related 
block diagram of a Category 2 single-channel machine 
control system featuring:
• A microcontroller
• A light barrier for the monitoring of hazard zones
• A “watchdog” for the detection of certain controller mal -
functions
• A closed-loop motor drive control (frequency inverter) 
driven by the controller
• A device for de-energization of the motor that can be 
actuated by the watchdog (pulse inhibit)

The safety function entails de-energization of the motor 
as soon as, and for as long as, the light beam of the light 
barrier is interrupted (“safe torque off”). Besides the 
safety function, the microcontroller and the downstream 
drive control perform a number of other machine func -
tions which, since they are not safety functions, will not 
be considered here. Although in this example, the safety 
function is implemented entirely electrically, the princip -
les described for the safety-related block diagram and the 
FMEA apply to all technologies. The safety-related block diagram contains only function 
blocks that are related to the “safe torque off” safety 
function; it does not contain control or display devices 
for other machine functions. In the event of a fault, some 
components in these circuit parts may have negative 
repercussions for the safety function. Only then should 
these components be included in the function blocks that 
they could cause to fail.
The safety-related block diagram will often take the form 
of one of the “designated architectures” in accordance 
with EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 6.2.2 (subclauses 6.2.1 to \n253Annex B
6.2.7 of this report), as in the example presented here. In 
such cases, the method described in subclause 4.5.4 of 
the standard (supplemented by Annexes B, C, D, E, I and 
K of the standard) may be applied for quantitative calcula -
tion of the Performance Level. It is not advisable however 
to shoehorn a different structure into the form of one of 
these architectures. It may be possible to break an exis -
ting system structure down into parts each of which then 
corresponds to a designated architecture. 
Should a breakdown of this kind not be possible, a dedi -
cated model must be produced for quantitative calcula -
tion of the safety-related reliability for the safety-related 
block diagram concerned. An introduction to suitable 
modelling techniques can be found for example in [1].
B.2 Purpose and characteristic of an FMEA  
for quantification
For quantitative demonstration of the PL, the average 
probability of a dangerous failure per hour ( PFHD) must 
be estimated. This can be achieved with the aid of a 
mathematical model (e.g. a Markov  model) generated for 
the system under consideration. If however the form of 
one of the “designated architectures” in accordance with 
subclauses 6.2.3 to 6.2.7 can be identified formally from 
the safety-related block diagram, as in the example in 
Figure B.1, the method in this standard referred to above 
can be applied for quantitative calculation of the PL. In both cases, the dangerous (i.e. unfavourable from a 
safety perspective) failure rate, specifically its reciprocal, 
the MTTFD (mean time to dangerous failure), and the DC 
(diagnostic coverage) of the function blocks in the safety-
related block diagram must be known. For calculation 
of these values, a special variation of the FMEA is used 
that employs the component failure rates in the form of 
quantitative values. The special form of the FMEA used 
here differs in this respect from the majority of other FMEA 
types, which are used for other purposes such as the early 
detection of problems and fault avoidance during deve -
lopment [2].
A particular feature of an FMEA for quantification purpo -
ses is its structure according to the function blocks of the 
safety-related block diagram. The principle is that a sepa -
rate FMEA is performed for each of these function blocks, 
and produces results only for the function block concer -
ned. The results for each function block are not combined 
until later, by inclusion together in the calculation of the 
PFHD/PL by way of a system-specific mathematical model 
or the simplified quantification method in EN ISO 13849-1.
B.2.1 Performance of an FMEA for quantifica -
tion

fication is demonstrated below with reference to the “light

“Light barrier” function block
Figure B.2:  
Assumed circuit (simple 
example) of the “light 
 barrier” function block 
from the safety-related 
block diagram from  
Figure B.1
For this purpose, the circuit has deliberately been kept 
simple. Only components framed by the dashed line 
belong to the function block. The elements S1 and P2 
constitute a substitute circuit for the actual inclusion of the function block within the system in accordance with 
Figure B.1. As long as the phototransistor K1 continues 
to receive light from the infrared LED P1, it maintains the 
transistor K2 blocked, as a result of which the transistor 
253\n254Annex B
K3 is conductive and a positive output voltage, which can 
be measured by the voltmeter P2, is present on terminal 
X1.2. If the light beam is interrupted, K1 blocks, K2 beco -
mes conductive and K3 switches off the output voltage. 
The test of the “light barrier” function block, which is per -
formed by the microcontroller control system in Figure B.1 
in accordance with the program, can be simulated by the 
pushbutton S1 and the voltmeter P2: the light source P1 is 
switched off temporarily and the output voltage ob  served 
for whether it drops to 0 V as intended. The signal-pro -
cessing elements of the “light barrier” function block (K1 
to K3, R2 to R9, C1) are required to behave in the same 
way as in response to a “real” demand of the safety func -
tion caused by interruption of the light beam. This test is 
described below as “Test 1”.
B.2.2  Dangerous failure mode of a function 
block
The first step entails identification of the dangerous fail-
ure mode of the function block. Generally, not only may 
individual elements fail, but an entire function block 
may also fail in various ways as a result. The modes of 
failure that are unfavourable from a safety perspective are 
regarded as the “dangerous” failure mode of a function 
block. Some failures cause immediate, dangerous fail-
ure of the entire system, with the result that neither the 
original safety function, nor a safety-oriented substitute 
function can be performed. Other failures increase the 
probability of this happening in that a smaller number of 
further failures is now sufficient to cause the system to fail 
dangerously. Should no redundancy exist for the function 
block suffering failure, i.e. no second channel capable of 
assuming its function, and should diagnostics fail to per -
form sufficiently rapidly an action producing a safe state, 
the dangerous failure of the function block leads to dan -
gerous failure of the system. However, even when, owing 
to the existence of redundancy or a rapid failure response 
by other circuit components, none of the possible failure 
modes of the function block under analysis causes a 
dangerous system failure, its “dangerous” failure mode 
can and must be identified. The dangerous failure mode 
is that leading to the function block no longer making its 
intended contribution to safe behaviour of the system. On 
occasions it may be necessary for several failure modes 
that are characterized by different but equally harmful 
block behaviour to be considered (e.g. continuous ener -
gization and oscillation on the output). The simplest solu -
tion is therefore to describe the dangerous failure mode 
in terms of the loss of the function block‘s safety-related 
functionality. Diagnostics features are considered later 
and will be ignored at this stage. In the example under 
consideration here (light barrier, Figure B.2), the output 
voltage of the function block is to drop to zero for as long 
as the phototransistor K1 fails to receive light from the LED 
P1, since this constitutes the contribution of this function block to performance of the safety function: “safe torque 
off when the light beam is interrupted”. 
The dangerous failure mode of the function block can thus 
be described as “presence of an output voltage greater 
than zero during non-illumination of the phototransistor 
K1”.
B.2.3 Component failure rates
Component failure rates may be obtained from a num -
ber of sources. Examples for electronic components are 
listed in [3 to 6]. These sources all contain generic data 
relevant to multiple manufacturers. Collections of failure 
rates also exist for mechanical, pneumatic and hydraulic 
components. For certain components that are not listed 
in the relevant indexes (such as special ASICs), the failure 
rate must be obtained from the manufacturer. Many com -
mon quantification techniques, including the simplified 
method in EN ISO 13849-1 subclause 4.5.4, assume a con -
stant failure rate over time. This represents an idealized 
view. With appropriate dimensioning and, if necessary, 
preventive replacement, components can be prevented 
from reaching the wear phase, during which the failure 
rate rises sharply, before the end of the mission time TM.
A quick source of generally conservative (pessimistic) 
estimations of failure rates can be found in EN ISO 13849, 
Part 1, Annex C. In particular, a method is shown here by 
which failure rates for discrete, cyclically operating elec -
tromechanical, fluid power and mechanical components 
can be derived from the “B10D” values (see Table D.2 of 
this report).
Should a conservative estimate of the failure rate not be 
chosen, it must be ensured for each component that the 
value employed is valid under the conditions of use (tem -
perature, current, voltage, power dissipation, etc.) in the 
application in question. The inherent heating effect must 
also be taken into account. Standard data sources, such 
as [3 to 6], provide measures by which the base failure 
rates applicable under defined reference conditions can 
be converted to values applicable under different condi -
tions. Suitable conversion formulae (but not base failure 
rates) can be found in [7].\n255Annex B
B.2.4 Production of an FMEA on a function-
block basis for quantification purposes
In the FMEA, the components of the function block are 
first assessed separately, and the complete assessment 
for the block is then derived from them. For practical 
purposes, a table documenting both the process and the 
results is employed. The level of accuracy employed for 
performance of the FMEA may be varied; the accuracy employed is reflected in variation in the overhead associ -
ated with generation of the tables required. One possible 
execution is shown by way of example in [8]. Binding rules 
do not exist. The variant shown in Figure B.3 represents 
a compromise between a high degree of accuracy and 
corresponding overhead on the one hand and excessive 
simplification on the other, and takes the accuracy and 
availability of the data used into account. The figures 
used are assumed example values.

Figure B.3:  
Reasonable form of execution of an 
FMEA table for the “light barrier” 
function block in Figure B.2
The components of the function block are listed in rows 
together with their failure rates. The usual unit for the fai -
lure rate is “FIT” (failures in time); 1 FIT = 10-9 per hour. The 
only weighting factor indicated here for the base failure rate is the temperature factor. Other adjustment factors 
may justifiably be ignored when the components are on 
average electrically overdimensioned, which is frequently 
the case. In such cases, their electrical load then lies pre -\n256Annex B
dominantly below the reference load upon which the base 
failure rate is based, with the result that the correspon -
ding adjustment factors are < 1. Omission of these factors 
thus constitutes an estimation erring on the safe side and 
at the same time a reduction in the required effort, since 
the precise electrical operating values for the components 
need not all be determined individually. Should it be 
known, however, that the load upon certain components 
lies above the reference load, the relevant adjustment fac -
tors must be considered. If the base failure rate of indivi -
dual components predominates within the function block, 
as is often the case for example for processors and power 
semiconductors, precise examination and if applicable 
consideration of all necessary adjustment factors for the 
components concerned must be examined precisely and 
given consideration where applicable.
In the next step, the total failure rate λ of each component 
is divided into the proportions λS (“safe” mode, i.e. safe 
failure) and λD (“dangerous” mode, i.e. dangerous failure). 
For this purpose, information such as the “dangerous 
failure mode” of the function block must be known (see 
above). A “puristic” approach requires this to be perfor -
med in two steps.
Firstly, the total failure rate is distributed between the 
various failure types (e.g. open circuit, short circuit, 
drift, change in function). Information on the failure type 
distribution of a range of components can be found for 
example in IEC 61709 [7] and IEC/TR 62380 [4]. Typical 
failure type distributions can also be found in commercial 
FMEDA software. The data in the various sources are not 
consistent. Unnecessary selection of a different source for 
the failure type distribution from component to compo -
nent is not acceptable.
In the second step, the proportions accounted for by each 
failure type are assigned to λS or λD, according to whether 
the failure type concerned causes the function block to 
fail in its safe or unsafe mode. A continuation in function 
without change is regarded in this case as a safe-mode 
failure.
Figure B.3 shows a simplified pragmatic approach that 
does not rely upon a particular source for the failure type 
distributions and that is limited to determining which of 
the three following cases applies to a component:
a) All failure types result in safe-mode failure of the func -
tion block, or have no impact upon its behaviour.
b) At least one failure type exists that causes the function 
block to fail safely, and one failure type that causes it 
to fail dangerously.
c) All failure types cause the function block to fail in its 
dangerous mode.In case a), the total failure rate λ is assigned to the failure 
rate λS in the safe failure mode (example: infrared LED 
P1). By the same token, in case c), the total failure rate λ 
is attributed to the failure rate λD in the dangerous failure 
mode (example: capacitor C1). In case b), the total failure 
rate λ is divided equally between λS and λD (example:  
transistor K2).
The simplified procedure shown in case b) is normally 
justified for components making only a small contribu -
tion to the total failure rate of the function block when it 
contains a large number of such components. Individual 
components with an above-average contribution to the 
total failure rate of the function block may have to be con -
sidered separately. The failure rate may also be divided 
equally between λS and λD for complex integrated circuits 
such as processors. The same applies to solder joints/
printed circuit boards. Caution is required with discrete or 
low-integration components with a relatively high failure 
rate. Should for example a contactor or a power semicon -
ductor contribute substantially to the total failure rate of 
the function block, failure should be assumed in cases of 
doubt to be predominantly dangerous. This applies even 
more to elements of safety outputs that switch output 
currents.
For components intended to enhance the circuit‘s resis -
tance to disturbance phenomena, such as electromag -
netic interference or excessive ambient temperature, it is 
advantageous to distinguish between two possible cases 
for assessment of the function block‘s behaviour. If the 
incidence of disturbance phenomena is merely “possible” 
and the function of the circuit measure is essentially to 
increase the availability of the device under (infrequent) 
unfavourable conditions, simultaneous presence of the 
“disturbance phenomenon” in the event of component 
failure need not be assumed during assessment of the 
function-block behaviour. Conversely, should the device‘s 
intended form of operation be associated with occasional 
to continuous presence of the disturbance or should this 
be anticipated in view of the typical operating conditions 
(e.g. installation within the range of known sources of 
electromagnetic interference or at a hot site), assessment 
of the component failure must take account of the dis -
turbance. The same applies to assessment of the failure 
detectability provided by diagnostics measures for these 
components.
Where components are subject to wear, a substitute 
failure rate constant over time is generally applied. This 
is calculated by means of formula C.5 in EN ISO 13849, 
Part 1, Annex C.4.2. The B10D value, which states the ave -
rage number of switching cycles before dangerous failure, 
is required for this purpose. The B10D value should ideally 
be obtained from the manufacturer of the component, 
who should also state which mode of failure was  
assumed for this purpose to be the dangerous mode  \n257Annex B
(e.g. the failure of contacts to open), since in principle, 
a mode of failure can be assessed as dangerous or not 
dangerous only with respect to a specific application. In 
many cases, only a manufacturer‘s B10 value (number of 
switching cycles before any form of failure) is available. 
For this case, calculation of the B10D value by means of 
the formula B10D = B10/RDF is sometimes recommended. 
RDF (ratio of dangerous failure) represents the fraction 
of the overall failure rate of an element that can result in 
a dangerous failure. EN ISO 13849-1, Annex C.4.2, Foot -
note 2 also follows this approach with RDF = 0.5. This 
method of calculation is however based upon simplified 
assumptions that may differ considerably from the actual 
conditions for the wearing parts under analysis here. For 
this reason, B10D should be limited to twice the value of B10 
when B10D is determined by means of the quotient B10/RDF. 
Owing to the relationship in formula C.3 in EN ISO 13849-
1, Annex C.4.2, the method for determining the B10D also 
has an impact upon the permissible component operation 
time T10D and thus possibly also upon replacement inter -
vals to be specified for the component.
The next step in the method entails consideration for 
diagnostics. Only diagnostics relating to dangerous-mode 
failures (of the function block) are considered. Conside -
ration for whether a test or where applicable several tests 
are capable of detecting some or all of these failures need 
therefore be given only for components that exhibit a 
portion of dangerous-mode failures. The relevant effective 
test, and the diagnostic coverage DC for the components 
indicating the detectable portion of dangerous-mode 
failures, are entered in appropriate columns. Where the 
components concerned are discrete components as in the 
example shown in Figure B.2, one of the two DC values 
“0” for “undetectable” or “1” for “detectable” can often 
be assigned to the dangerous failure of a single compo -
nent. In the case of complex integrated components and 
of discrete components the failure of which is capable of 
impairing the function of such a complex component, the 
component-related DC must be estimated in considera -
tion both of the dangerous failure mode and of the availa -
ble test method. Support in this assessment is provided 
by Table E.2, in which DC values of 0% (“none”), 60% 
(“low”), 90% (“medium”) and 99% (“high”) are assigned 
for standard test methods. During assignment of a DC to a 
component, it must also be considered that an evaluation 
result of “detectable” is permissible only if the system is 
actually capable of performing the intended safety-orien -
ted operation. Detection of a failure within a circuit, for 
example, is useless if it is rendered ineffective owing to a 
shut-off path that has already failed.
In the example shown, the components R1, R6 to R9 and 
P1 do not need to be considered with regard to the aspect 
of diagnostics, since they are not capable of causing dan -
gerous-mode failure of the “light barrier” function block. 
The dangerous-mode failure portion of each of these components is 0. Dangerous-mode failure of elements 
R2 to R5, K1 to K3 and X1 is detected fully by “Test 1” (the 
only test in this example), i.e. when LED P1 is switched 
off for test purposes, the test detects an output voltage 
of > 0. The component-related DC value of “1” is therefore 
assigned to these elements. The situation is different for 
the capacitor C1, which has the function of suppressing 
frequent but not continuous electromagnetic interference 
(note: this is assumed for the purpose of this example). 
Drift failures (limited changes in capacitance) are not 
critical; a short-circuit, however, results in the output (ter -
minal X1.2) being incapable of being de-energized (dan -
gerous failure mode of the function block). A short-circuit 
on C1 is detected by Test 1. In the event of an open circuit 
on C1, the electromagnetic interference is transported via 
K2 and K3 to the output of the function block. It is un clear 
how the downstream circuit will interpret this high-fre-
quen cy alternating signal, and also whether the distur -
bance phenomenon is present during the test. In the 
worst case, the non-suppressed interference results in the 
output signal with superimposed disturbance not being 
interpreted by the downstream circuit as a demand of the 
safety function, despite phototransistor K1 not being illu -
minated (= dangerous failure of the “light barrier” func -
tion block). Should the fault not be present at the time 
of the test, Test 1 is not able to detect the capacitor open 
circuit. Since no reliable information on the failure-type 
distribution is available for the capacitor, it is assumed 
that – when the non-critical drift failures are disregarded 
– short circuits and open circuits each account for 50% of 
the failures. Both failure types lead to a dangerous failure 
of the function block; only short-circuiting of the capa -
citor, i.e. (an estimated) half of all dangerous capacitor 
failures, are however reliably detectable. The component-
related diagnostic coverage is thus estimated at 50% or 
0.5. The printed circuit board and its solder joints can 
introduce short circuits and open circuits into the circuit 
at various points. The pragmatic approach, implemented 
in Figure B.3, for estimation of the DC value for the sol -
der joints and printed circuit board consists in assigning 
the average DC value to them that is produced for all 
other components of the function block from the formula 
DC = Σ λDD/Σ λD. The inclusion of the printed circuit board 
and solder joints thus has no influence upon the DC value 
calculated for the complete function block.
In each row of the table, i.e. for each component:
λ  =  temperature factor  ·  base failure rate (if applicable  
         with further correction factors, see above) 
λS   = proportion of safe failures ⋅ λ
λD   = proportion of dangerous failures ⋅ λ 
λDD = DC ⋅ λD\n258Annex B
λDU = (1 – DC) ⋅ λD
These λ values are summed by column in the table. The 
sum λD and the sums λD and λDD yield the MTTFD, i.e. the 
mean time to a dangerous failure of the function block, 
and the DC of the function block respectively:
MTTFD = 1/λD
DC = λDD/λD
The only input values required for determining the PL 
for one of the designated architectures in accordance 
with subclauses 6.2.3 to 6.2.7 are the MTTFD and DC. The 
example shown yields an MTTFD value of 9,905.9 years 
and a DC of 91.72%. If a different quantification method is 
employed, values from the FMEA table such as λDD and λDU 
may also be used.
B.3 Parts count method
Time and effort can be saved by use of a simpler method 
instead of an FMEA. If a detailed analysis of the circuit 
behaviour is not performed for the various failure types 
of the individual elements, the parts count method is an 
alternative (cf. Annex D of this report). This method was 
originally found in the MIL Handbook 217F (superseded 
by [6]), and a variant of it is described in EN ISO 13849, 
Part 1, Annex D.1. If at the same time relatively conser -
vative (high) failure rates are assumed, the failure rates 
require no adjustment to the actual operating conditions. 
In addition, a dangerous failure proportion of 50% – with 
regard to the function block – is frequently assumed for 
many components. The table is thus simplified if super -
fluous columns for weighting and proportioning of the 
failure rates are omitted from the FMEA table. The parts 
count method normally delivers poorer (lower) MTTFD 
values than the FMEA results, since higher failure rates 
are generally input, and components are also considered 
that are capable of causing only safe-mode function-block 
failures. 
If the parts count principle is applied to the example 
described above (light barrier), with assumption of the 
failure rates adjusted for temperature in Figure B.3 and a 
blanket proportion of dangerous failures for all compo -
nents of 50%, the resulting MTTFD value is 7 ,310.8 years. 
This value is approximately 26% poorer than the FMEA 
result. The inferior value is due in this example solely to 
the omission of a circuit analysis. If a DC value is required 
for the function block, the component-related DC for each 
component must estimated as with the FMEA method or, 
for example with reference to Annex E, the DC of the entire 
function block.
The FMEA method for quantification purposes presented 
in this annex of the report with reference to an electronic circuit can be transferred to other technologies. It can 
therefore be applied formally in the same manner for 
example to mechanical, hydraulic and pneumatic sys -
tems.

Fault lists, fault exclusions and safety principles
C.1 Fault lists
The faults to be assumed for mechanical, pneumatic, 
hydraulic and electrical components during the validation 
of an SRP/CS and the fault exclusions that are possible 
can be found in fault lists in EN ISO 13849-2 [1], Annexes A 
to D. Individual product standards such as IEC 61800-5-2 
[2] and IEC 61496-1 [3] also contain fault lists or supple -
ments to the fault lists stated. Document 340 220 in the 
IFA Manual [4] explains the background and origins of the 
fault lists.
C.2 Fault exclusions
Without the assumption of fault exclusions, some safe 
control systems would not be achievable at reasonable 
expense. Reasons for fault exclusion include, in particu -
lar, the physical impossibility of a certain type of fault or 
the technical improbability of a fault occurring, and also 
generally accepted technical experience (see also sub -
clause 7 .3 of EN ISO 13849-1). Fault exclusions are also 
possible for newly developed components. The precise 
reasoning for each fault exclusion must be stated in the 
technical documentation. EN ISO 13849-2 describes pos -
sible fault exclusions for certain discrete components, 
where considered permissible. The information in the 
following examples has been updated where required to 
bring it into line with standard practice.
C.2.1 Examples of fault exclusions  
on components
C.2.1.1 Fluid power components
The fault exclusions formulated for pneumatic and 
hy draulic components are frequently similar. Fault exclu -
sions specific to one of the forms of fluid power also exist, 
however.
Example of fault exclusions common to fluid power  
components of both types:
• Directional control valves
The fault assumption: “failure to switch or failure to 
switch completely” can be excluded under the fol -
lowing conditions: positive mechanical operation of 
the moving parts, provided the actuating force is suf -
ficiently high. On hydraulic directional control valves, 
a fault exclusion can be formulated for the failure of 
a special type of seat and cartridge valve (refer to the 
remarks in EN ISO 13849-2, Table C.3) to open when it controls the main volumetric flow of the pressure 
medium in conjunction with at least one further valve.
C.2.1.2 Electrical components
• Optocouplers
The fault assumption of a “short-circuit between any 
two input and output connections” can be excluded 
under the following conditions: the optocoupler is con -
structed in accordance with overvoltage Category III to 
IEC 60664-1. If an SELV/PELV power supply is employed, 
pollution degree 2/overvoltage Category II is sufficient. 
Measures are taken to ensure that an internal fault in 
the optocoupler cannot lead to an excessive rise in the 
temperature of its insulating materials.
• Printed circuit board/populated printed circuit board
In accordance with the standard, the fault assumption 
of a “short-circuit between adjacent tracks/pads” can 
be excluded provided the following conditions are met:
 – A base material of at least EP GC to IEC 60893-1  
is employed.
 –Creepage distances and clearances are dimensioned 
to at least IEC 60664-5 (for distances greater than  
2 mm: IEC 60664-1) with pollution degree 2/overvol -
tage Category III. If both conductor tracks are powered 
by an SELV/PELV power supply, pollution degree 2/
overvoltage Category II with a minimum clearance of 
0.1 mm applies.
 –The assembled board is mounted in an enclosure 
giving ingress protection of at least IP 54, and the 
printed side is coated with an ageing-resistant varnish 
or other form of protective coating that is resistant to 
ageing and that covers all tracks.
 –In practice, it is now also acceptable for a high-quality 
solder resist or similar to be employed for the ageing-
resistant varnish/protective coating. Supplementary 
coating of printed circuit boards in accordance with 
IEC 60664-3 may reduce the pollution degree for -
ming the basis of the assumption, and thus also the 
re quired creepage distances and clearances.
Where lead-free soldering methods and products are 
used, the formation of tin whiskers may give rise to 
electrical short-circuits. Tin whiskers are formed pri -
marily on surfaces with a clean, shiny tin coating. The \n260Annex C
projections, needle-like in form, may attain lengths of 
over 1 mm (note: a much lower value is stated in [1]) and 
cause electrical short circuits. The prevailing theory is 
that whiskers are caused by pressure arising during the 
tinning process. This possibility should be evaluated, 
particularly when fault exclusion is applied to a compo -
nent, for example exclusion of a short-circuit.
If the risk of tin whisker formation is considered high, 
fault exclusion for a short circuit between component 
terminals on a PCB is not possible, even when the 
above conditions are satisfied. Whiskers on conductor 
tracks of PCBs have not been determined in the past. 
The conductor tracks are usually of copper, without tin 
coating. The reference [5; 6] can assist in assessment of 
the phenomenon.
• Conductors/cables
The fault assumption of a “short-circuit between any 
two conductors” can be excluded when the conductors: 
 –are permanently connected (fixed) and protected 
against external damage (e.g. by cable ducting, 
armouring); or
 –are laid in separate multicore cables or within an elec -
trical compartment; or
 –are individually shielded with earth connection.
A condition of the above is that the conductors and the 
compartment both satisfy the relevant requirements 
(see IEC 60204-1).
• Electromechanical position switches, manually opera -
ted switches
Exclusion of the “Contact will not open” fault can be  
assumed subject to the following condition:
 –Contacts to IEC 60947-5-1:2003, Annex K open of their 
own accord. Note that this fault exclusion applies only 
to the electrical part of the switch (the fault exclusion 
is from the fault list for the electrical system). Sub -
clause D.2.5 contains detailed information on the 
subjects of fault exclusion and modelling of electro -
mechanical components.
C.3 Basic safety principles
Basic safety principles are governed in Tables A.1, B.1, C.1 
and D.1 of the informative annexes of EN ISO 13849-2.C.3.1 Applicable to all technologies
• Use of suitable materials and adequate manufacturing 
Materials and processes for manufacture and treatment 
are selected with consideration for the use and stres -
ses.
• Proper dimensioning and geometry of all components
All components are selected in consideration of their 
compatibility with the anticipated operating conditions. 
Further criteria include switching capacity, rate of ope -
rations, withstand voltage, pressure level, dynamic 
pressure behaviour, volumetric flow, temperature and 
viscosity of the hydraulic fluid, type and condition of the 
hydraulic fluid or compressed air.
• All components are resistant to the environmental  
conditions and relevant external influences.
The SRP/CS is designed to be able to perform its func -
tions under the external influences usually associated 
with the application. Important criteria include mecha -
nical influences, climatic influences, the leak tightness 
of the enclosure, and the resistance to electromagnetic 
interference.
• Principle of de-energization (closed-circuit current  
principle)
The safe state is attained by removal of the control sig -
nal (voltage, pressure), i.e. by de-energization. Impor -
tant criteria include the safe state when the energy sup -
ply is interrupted, or effective spring return on valves in 
fluid power technology.
• Protection against unexpected start-up
Unexpected start-up, caused for example by stored 
energy or upon restoration of the power supply, is pre -
vented.
C.3.2 Examples of basic safety principles in 
fluid power technology
• Pressure limitation
The pressure within a system or in subsystems is gene -
rally prevented from rising beyond a specified level 
by one or more pressure-relief valve(s). In pneumatic 
systems, pressure-control valves with self-venting are 
primarily employed for this purpose.\n261Annex C
• Measures for the avoidance of impurities in the  
pressure medium
The required purity grade of the pressure medium for 
the components used is attained by suitable equip -
ment, generally a filter. In pneumatics, suitable dehumi -
dification is also required.
C.3.3 Examples of basic safety principles  
in electrical technology
• Correct protective bonding
One side of the control circuit, one terminal of each 
electromagnetically actuated device or one terminal 
of other electrical devices is connected to a protective 
earth conductor. This side of the device is not therefore 
used for example for deactivation of a hazardous move -
ment. A short-circuit to ground cannot therefore result 
in (undetected) failure of a shut-off path.
• Transient suppression
A facility for the transient suppression (RC element, 
diode, varistor) is connected in parallel with the load 
(not in parallel with the contacts).
C.3.4  Examples of basic safety principles  
in programmable systems/software
EN ISO 13849-2 does not describe basic safety principles 
for the use of programmable systems and software. The 
basic measures for SRESW and SRASW in accordance with 
subclauses 4.6.2 and 4.6.3 of the standard may however 
be regarded as basic safety principles (refer also to sub -
clause 6.3). A further measure is monitoring of execution 
of the program in order to detect a defective sequence of 
commands/software modules, which may occur despite 
all care taken during verification and validation. Program 
sequence monitoring is generally implemented by means 
of an external, cyclically retriggered watchdog that must 
be capable of placing the SRP/CS in a defined safe state 
in the event of a defective execution of the program.
C.4  Well-tried safety principles
Tables A.2, B.2, C.2 and D.2 in the informative annexes of 
EN ISO 13849-2 address well-tried safety principles. Well-
tried safety principles are employed in order to minimize 
or exclude critical faults or failures and thus to reduce the 
probability of faults or failures with an influence upon the 
safety function.C.4.1  General well-tried safety principles for all 
technologies
• Overdimensioning/safety factor
All equipment is subjected to loading below its rated 
values. The objective is to reduce the probability of  
failure.
• Positive mode of actuation
Reliable actuation by rigid mechanical parts with posi -
tive, rigid rather than sprung connections. The objec -
tive is to attain reliable transmission of commands, 
for example by the direct opening of a contact when a 
position switch is actuated, even should the contact be 
welded.
• Limiting of electrical and/or mechanical parameters
Force, distance, time, and rotational and linear speeds 
are reduced to permissible values by electrical, mechani -
cal or fluid power equipment. The objective is to reduce 
the risk by improved control of hazards.
C.4.2  Examples of well-tried safety principles  
in fluid power technology
• Secure position
The moving element of a component is held mechani -
cally in a possible position (frictional restraint is not 
sufficient). Force must be generated in order for the 
position to be changed.
• Use of well-tried springs
EN ISO 13849-2, Table A.2 contains detailed require -
ments for well-tried springs.
C.4.3  Examples of well-tried safety principles  
in electrical technology
• Limiting of electrical parameters
Limiting of voltage, current, energy or frequency, for the 
avoidance of an unsafe state
• No undefined states
Undefined states in the SRP/CS must be avoided. The 
SRP/CS must be designed such that its state can be 
predetermined during normal operation and under all 
anticipated operating conditions. This is to be achieved 
for example by the use of components with defined 
response behaviour (switching thresholds, hysteresis) 
and with a defined sequence of operations.\n262Annex C
• Separation of non-safety and safety functions
In order to prevent unexpectec influences upon safety 
functions, the functions concerned are implemented 
separately from non-safety functions.
C.4.4  Examples of well-tried safety principles  
in programmable systems/software
EN ISO 13849-2 does not describe well-tried safety prin -
ciples for the use of programmable systems and soft -
ware. The additional measures for SRESW and SRASW 
in accordance with subclauses 4.6.2 and 4.6.3 of the 
standard may however be regarded as well-tried safety 
principles (refer also to subclause 6.3). A further well-tried 
safety principle is the use of self-tests for the detection 
of faults in complex components such as microcont -
rollers. Table E.1 of the standard for estimation of the 
level of diagnostic coverage lists self-tests of this kind, 
such as memory tests and CPU tests. Information on the 
implementation of such tests can also be found in a BGIA 
Report [7]. Depending upon the application, “fault detec -
tion by the process” and “fault detection by comparison 
between channels” may be regarded as well-tried safety 
principles.
C.5 Well-tried components
Well-tried components for mechanical and electrical 
systems are dealt with by Tables A.3 and D.3 of the infor -
mative annexes of EN ISO 13849-2. Well-tried components 
are used in order to minimize or exclude critical faults or 
failures and thus to reduce the probability of faults or fail-
ures that impact upon the safety function. In accordance 
with the provisions for Category 1, general criteria for a 
well-tried component are that it:
a) has been widely used in the past with successful 
results in similar applications; or
b) has been made and verified using principles which 
demonstrate its suitability and reliability for safety-
related applications.
Complex electronic components (such as PLCs, micropro -
cessors, ASICs) cannot be regarded as well-tried in the 
sense of the standard. Classification as a well-tried com -
ponent is also dependent upon the application: a compo -
nent may be considered well-tried in certain applications, 
whereas in other applications this must be excluded, for 
example owing to the environmental influences.C.5.1 Example of a well-tried component  
in mechanical technology
• Spring
A spring is deemed to be a well-tried component when 
the provisions in EN ISO 13849-2, Table A.2 concerning 
well-tried safety principles for the application of well-
tried springs and the technical provisions for spring 
steels to ISO 4960 [8] are observed.
C.5.2  Examples of well-tried components  
in fluid power technology
EN ISO 13849-2 states no well-tried components for fluid 
power technology. The property of being well-tried is 
particularly dependent upon the application in question 
and upon observance of the requirements for well-tried 
components in Category 1 and the requirements of 
EN ISO 4413 [9] and EN ISO 4414 [10].
Examples of well-tried components for safety-related 
applications are:
• Directional control valves, stop valves and pressure 
valves
C.5.3 Examples of well-tried components  
in electrical technology
• Fuse
Fuses and miniature circuit-breakers are equipment for 
protection against overcurrent. They interrupt an elec -
trical circuit (de-energization principle) in the event of 
an excessively high current, caused for example by an 
insulation fault. A distinction must be drawn  between 
fuses and circuit breakers. Lead fuses have for deca -
des proved effective in protecting against overcurrent. 
Comprehensive provisions exist governing fuses [11; 12]. 
Provided they are used as intended and are correctly 
rated, failure of fuses can virtually be excluded.
• Emergency switching off device/emergency stop device
Devices for emergency switching off and emergency 
stop in accordance with EN ISO 13850 [12] are employed 
for the initiation of action in an emergency. Both types 
of device feature direct opening auxiliary switches for 
interruption of the energy supply in accordance with 
Annex K of IEC 60947-5-1 [13]. A distinction is drawn 
between two types of auxiliary switch with direct ope -
ning action:
 –Type 1: with only one contact element, in the form of a 
direct opening contact\n263Annex C
 –Type 2: with one or more break contact elements and 
possibly with one or more make contact elements 
and/or one or more changeover contacts. All break 
contact elements, including the contact-breaking 
parts of the changeover contacts, must feature direct 
opening contact elements.
For further details, particularly concerning the model -
ling of emergency-stop devices, refer to subclause 
D.2.5.4.
• Switches with positive mode of actuation (direct  
opening action) 
This particular type of switch is available commercially 
as a push-button, position switch, and selector switch 
with cam actuation, for example for the selection of 
operating modes. These switches have proved effective 
over many decades. They are based upon the well-tried 
safety principle of the positive mode of actuation by 
direct opening contacts. To be deemed a well-tried 
component, the switch must satisfy the requirements of 
IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K [13].

D.1  What does “ MTTFD” mean?
The mean time to dangerous failure MTTFD describes the 
reliability of the components used in a control system, 
and is one of several parameters that are used to deter -
mine the Performance Level. The MTTFD is defined in 
EN ISO 13849-1 as the “expectation of the mean time to 
dangerous failure”. This emphasizes several aspects:
• The MTTFD is a statistical value, i.e. a value of empirical 
origin; in no way does it refer to a “guaranteed lifetime”, 
“failure-free time”, or the like.
• The MTTFD has the physical dimension of a period of 
time, and is generally stated in years.
• Only dangerous-mode failures are relevant, i.e. failures 
that impair performance of the safety function. Should 
the safety function be executed by several channels 
(redundancy), the term “dangerous failure” is used 
even if only one channel is affected.D.1.1  Bath-tub life curve and constant  
failure rate
Component reliability is commonly described in terms of 
failure rates, abbreviated λ (and accordingly λD for dan -
gerous failures only), the usual unit being FIT (failures 
in time, i.e. number of failures in 109 component hours, 
1 FIT = 10-9 per hour). This failure rate describes the rate, at 
a particular point in time, at which functional components 
fail. In other words, the number of failures per unit time is 
divided by the number of components which at the point 
in time concerned have not yet suffered failure. The failure 
mode of many types of components (particularly electro -
nic components) as a function of time takes the form, to a 
greater or lesser degree, of a “bath-tub life curve” [1] (see 
Figure D.1).

“Bath-tub life curve” of the failure rate
A greater number of components generally fail at the 
beginning of the mission time. These early failures domi -
nate only for a short period. Once the recommended mis -
sion time has been exceeded, the failures begin to rise 
again. In the mid-range of the usual mission time, a pla -
teau of a constant failure rate is often observed, particu -
larly for electronic components. Random failures are typi -
cal for this phase. Even components which are affected 
more strongly by wear than by random failures, such as 
electromechanical or pneumatic components, can often 
be described over their mission time by the assumption  
of a constant failure rate estimated erring on the safe 
side. Early failures are generally disregarded, since com -\n266Annex D
ponents exhibiting pronounced early failure patterns do 
not satisfy the availability requirements for a machine 
control system and are therefore not generally signifi -
cant on the market. Suitable measures for the reduction 
of early failures are premature ageing (burn-in), selec -
tion, and optimization of the manufacturing process. In 
the interests of simplicity, constant failure rates within 
the mission time are therefore generally assumed in 
EN ISO 13849-1. The advantage of this assumption is 
that subsequent mathematical analysis is considerably 
simplified as a result, and forms the basis for the Markov  
modelling of the designated architectures upon which the 
bar chart/the simplified method of EN ISO 13849-1 are 
based. A constant failure rate results mathematically in a 
reliability curve which falls exponentially over the mission 
time, and in an anticipated value for the time to failure 
(MTTFD) which corresponds to the reciprocal of the failure 
rate, i.e.:
MTTFDλD1= (D.1)
 
At a constant failure rate, the MTTFD is therefore equiva -
lent to statement of a failure rate, whilst being much more 
illustrative. Whereas the practical significance of an FIT 
value is not very illustrative, statement of an anticipated 
time in years conveys the quality of components more 
graphically. Figure D.2 shows the statistically anticipated 
development of the proportion of dangerous failures 
over the mission time for four different MTTFD values. A 
further mathematical relationship can be observed here: 
at attainment of the MTTFD mark on the time axis, a stati -stical average of approximately 63% of all initially intact 
components have failed dangerously (not 50%, since 
although more components fail prior to attainment of the 
MTTFD, the remaining, intact components with residual 
operation times in some cases of several times the MTTFD 
are of greater statistical influence).
D.1.2  Division into classes and capping
The assumption of an MTTFD for each component of rele -
vance to safety (where reasons are not given for a fault 
exclusion) is a condition for the following steps, by which 
the MTTFD of each channel is produced, first at block and 
then at channel level. At channel level, EN ISO 13849-1 
proposes division into three typical MTTFD classes (see 
Table D.1). These classes are intended to cancel out minor 
differences between the calculated  MTTFD values, which 
in any case become irrelevant within the statistical uncer -
tainty. They also serve to retain the equivalence to the 
other parameters (five Categories, four DC levels), and to 
provide the necessary simplification for presentation in 
the bar chart.

The simplified quantification method to EN ISO 13849-1 
assumes a usual mission time not exceeding 20 years for 
components in safety-related control systems in machine 
construction. Consequently, and with knowledge of the 
characteristic of the failure rate over time (Figure D.1), 
it becomes clear that a declared MTTFD value should be understood only as an illustrative indicator of the level 
of reliability within the mission time, and that it serves 
neither as a guarantee of a failure-free period before the 
MTTFD is reached, nor as a precise prediction of the point 
in time at which an individual component will fail. Once 
the wear phase is reached, the failure behaviour changes \n267Annex D
fundamentally and can no longer be described realisti -
cally by a constant failure rate.
Desired side-effects of this classification are the rejec -
tion of MTTFD values of < 3 years from each channel, and 
the capping of higher MTTFD values for each channel 
to a maximum of 100 years (this capping is raised to 
2,500 years for Category 4; these values are also to be 
assigned to the “high” class). Figure D.2 shows that with 
an MTTFD of three years, almost 30% dangerous failures 
can be expected after just one year, which would appear 
to be unacceptable for a safety-related control system. At 
the other end of the scale, statistical validation of relia -
bilities of > 100 years MTTFD appears highly questionable 
(this is acceptable in Category 4, since the other parame -
ters determining the reliability, such as redundancy and 
fault detection, already have a high level). Furthermore, a 
residual probability of a dangerous failure within the mis -
sion time remains at MTTFD values of any magnitude, and 
may occur for other reasons (e.g. maloperation). It there -
fore appears inappropriate to validate high Performance 
Levels solely by the use of highly reliable components, 
without appropriate redundancy and fault detection. 
In the bar chart to EN ISO 13849-1, this conclusion is 
expressed by the fact that no further MTTFD range is shown 
above the “high” MTTFD class, even though this would be 
possible according to the calculated probability. Higher 
MTTFD values are not capped to the maximum value of 
100/2,500 years until the channel level, i.e. substantially 
higher MTTFD values may be substituted in the calculation 
for individual components.
D.1.3  What is the origin of the data?
A possible problem for users of the standard, particularly 
at the point at which the revised EN ISO 13849-1 was first 
published, was the lack of MTTFD data for components 
used in the SRP/CS [2]. In subclause 4.5.2, the standard 
proposes a hierarchy of data sources. The first of these 
are manufacturer's data [M], followed by typical values 
listed in the standard itself [S], and finally a very con -
servatively estimated substitutional value of ten years. 
Since this substitutional value relates to a component, 
and the lower limit of three years for the MTTFD value is 
soon reached where several components are employed 
in a channel, the MTTFD values listed in the standard itself 
were and are of particular importance. This will continue 
to be the case, at least until statement by the manufac -
turers of MTTFD values becomes the norm – including for 
components that were not developed from the outset for 
use in SRP/CS.
D.2  Differences between technologies
By its nature, the failure mode of components varies 
strongly according to the technology employed, since 
the “bath-tub characteristic” and the relevance of wear factors may differ. A very high MTTFD may be assumed for 
mechanical and hydraulic components, which are opti -
mized in their design and use for high reliability and low 
wear. Random failures (in the constant failure rate phase) 
and wear failures are less significant for these compo -
nents. Conversely, for the majority of electronic compo -
nents, the failure behaviour over the typical mission time 
of comparatively “cheap” industrial components is gene -
rally well described by a constant failure rate, since the 
wear phase is reached only under exacerbated operating 
conditions. The failure behaviour of electromechanical 
or pneumatic components is very different again in its 
nature. The wear phase of these components can easily 
be reached within the usual mission time. For this reason, 
the attainable number of successful operation cycles is 
generally stated as the parameter, rather than a lifetime in 
terms of a time or failure rate per unit time. Consideration 
must be given to all these technology-specific aspects 
during calculation of the MTTFD value. For this reason, the 
standard proposes differentiated procedures.
D.2.1 MTTFD of mechanical control components
The approach employing constant failure rates is, unfor -
tunately, not well suited to mechanical control com -
ponents. At the same time, almost all safety functions 
involve mechanical control elements, at least where 
the sensors or actuators of mechanical control compo -
nents are concerned that have the function for example 
of detecting movements or stopping hazardous move -
ments. Although it would often be possible for an MTTFD 
estimated erring on the safe side to be stated for these 
components, fault exclusion is generally employed in this 
case. Provided the requirements for the fault exclusion 
are observed and documented, this is generally the most 
elegant means of considering the reliability of the mecha -
nical components. These requirements include adequate 
resistance to the anticipated environmental influences, 
i.e. the validity of a fault exclusion depends upon the 
selected application. Another requirement is that of ade -
quate overdimensioning, which ensures for example that 
the mechanical components are subjected to stress only 
within the fatigue limit. If fault exclusion is not possible, 
the good engineering practice procedure described below 
may provide a means by which an MTTFD value can be 
estimated.
D.2.2  BIA-Report 6/2004, “Untersuchung des 
Alterungsprozesses von hydrau  lischen 
Wegeventilen” (study of the ageing 
process of hydraulic directional control 
valves)
On hydraulic systems, valves warrant special conside -
ration as a “safety-related part of the control system”; 
valves that control hazardous movements or states, in 
particular, are extremely important for calculation of \n268Annex D
the Performance Level. Experience has shown that the 
failure behaviour of hydraulic valves is characterized 
less by random failures than by failures due to wear. The 
causes of such failures are primarily systematic, such 
as excessive stress, unfavourable conditions of use, or 
lack of maintenance. In order for the lifetime of hydraulic 
valves to be estimated better, the IFA (at that time still 
the BGIA)  launched a degree thesis on the subject, the 
results of which are available in the form of BIA-Report 
6/2004, “Untersuchung des Alterungsprozesses von 
hydraulischen Wegeventilen” [3] (study of the ageing 
process of hydraulic directional control valves). Since 
valves that assume control tasks are generally piston-type 
directional control valves, the MTTFD values for “hydraulic 
components” were determined on valves of this type. The 
most important results of this study are presented briefly 
below.
Estimation of an MTTFD value is based in the first instance 
upon failure rates for hydraulic piston-type directional 
control valves that were determined in a study conducted 
in the maintenance departments of two large-scale users 
of hydraulic equipment (referred to below as users A and 
B). The failure rates were determined by the evaluation 
of computer data (quantities of re-ordered hydraulic 
piston-type directional control valves, repair reports) 
and involvement in maintenance work. In addition to the 
failure data for the valves, the operating conditions were 
also taken into account. The comparability of the MTTFD 
values determined for the different users of hydraulic sys -
tems is therefore assured. For validation and confirmation 
of these data, further failure data were collected by a sur -
vey of valve manufacturers. In the case of User A, the fail-
ure rates for the directional control valves were recorded 
in the maintenance department of a transmission pro -
duction plant. Data were available for all failures of direc -
tional control valves over a period of 38 months, during 
which 143 directional control valves failed. Approximately 
8,050 directional control valves of various ages were in 
use on the machines, for the most part machine tools, in 
the transmission production plant. If a constant failure 
rate is assumed during this period, an MTTFD of 178 years 
can be calculated as the reciprocal of the failure rate from 
the data for User A. At this user's plant, the operating con -
ditions specified by the manufacturers were observed for 
the most part on the hydraulic systems. Since the facility 
primarily comprised new production lines, condition-
based maintenance was performed.
The failure data for the directional control valves at User 
B's facility were likewise recorded in the maintenance 
department of a transmission production plant. Appro -
ximately 25,000 directional control valves varying in age 
were in use in this case. Data were available for all direc -
tional control valves that had failed over a period of four 
years (2000 to 2003). In contrast to User A's situation, the 
failure data for each year were available. It was therefore possible to calculate an MTTFD for each individual year. 
The MTTFD rose, from 195 years in 2000 to 300 in 2003. 
A significant relationship was observed between valve 
failures and operating/environmental conditions, since 
the maintenance measures and operating conditions in 
User B's facility had been improved continually over the 
years. In addition, the operating conditions were superior 
to those in User A's plant owing to further measures, such 
as monitoring of the fluid temperature; larger fluid reser -
voirs, generally located outside the machine; finer return 
line filters; and flue gas discharge systems for reducing 
the impurities in the ambient atmosphere. The study 
showed that, in conjunction with the type, quality, and 
level of contamination of the hydraulic fluid used and the 
design, material and type of the centering/return spring, 
the cylindrical guides of the components in valves, e.g. 
spool valves, had a substantial influence upon the antici -
pated lifetime of hydraulic piston-type directional control 
valves. A clear relationship was also established between 
the quality of the operating conditions and the attained 
lifetime to failure over a defined period of observation.
D.2.3 MTTFD of hydraulic control components
Based upon the results of the above study, an MTTFD 
of 150 to 1,200 years is proposed in EN ISO 13849-1 for 
hydraulic components, provided certain conditions are 
met. The valves studied were primarily of the piston type. 
Owing to the similarity in failure behaviour, however, 
the lifetime MTTFD determined for these valves serves 
as a good estimation for all safety-related hydraulic 
valves. This is however conditional upon observance 
during design and manufacture of the basic and well-
tried safety principles described in EN ISO 13849-2 for 
hy draulic valves. The basic and well-tried safety principles 
for application, likewise described in EN ISO 13849-2, 
must also be stated by the valve manufacturer (in the 
manufacturer's data, operating conditions) and observed 
in practice.
Annex C.2, Table C.1 of EN ISO 13849-2 states the basic 
safety principles for hydraulic systems. The most impor -
tant principles include the use of suitable materials and 
manufacturing procedures, and the principles of isolation, 
pressure limitation, protection against unexpected start-
up, and a suitable temperature range (for further details, 
see Annex C).
Annex C.3, Table C.2 of EN ISO 13849-2 lists well-tried 
safety principles for hydraulic systems. The most impor -
tant principles comprise overdimensioning/safety factors, 
speed limitation/reduction by means of a resistance for 
attainment of a defined volumetric flow, force limita -
tion/reduction, an appropriate range for the operating 
conditions, monitoring of the condition of the pressure 
medium, the use of well-tried springs, and sufficient over -\n269Annex D
lap in piston-type valves (for further details, refer again to 
Annex C).
Experience gained through application of the second edi -
tion of the standard has shown that for hydraulic valves, 
the frequency of actuation nop (number of actuations per 
year, see subclause D.2.4) is also a relevant parameter 
for the reliability. For this reason, the third edition of the 
standard states graded MTTFD values of between 150 
and 1,200 years for hydraulic valves (see Table D.2) as a 
function of nop as part of the good engineering practice 
method (see subclause D.2.5).
Even though the standard states MTTFD values for hydrau -
lic valves subject to these conditions, each valve manu -
facturer should, if at all possible, determine failure stati -
stics for his own components and state an MTTFD value of 
his own.
D.2.4  MTTFD of pneumatic and electro-
mechanical control components
In fluid power, mechanical and electromechanical tech -
nology, the lifetime and reliability of the components are 
generally determined by the wear characteristics of the 
moving elements.
In fluid power components such as valves, which gene -
rally constitute complex units with a large number of 
moving elements (such as pistons, plungers, springs in 
the pilot and main stages), the operational environmental 
conditions may also strongly influence the lifetime. These 
include, in particular:
• The quality and condition of the pressure medium  
(compressed air)
• Compatibility of seals with the lubricants
• Temperature influences
• Environmental influences such as dusts, gases, fluids  
Observance of the requirements specified by the compo -
nent manufacturer is crucial, since the parameters for the 
failure behaviour of the component from which the control 
system category is calculated are not otherwise valid.
A distinction is drawn between contactors and contactor 
relays. Contactor relays are used to implement logic and 
to drive contactors. Where higher power ratings must be 
switched, for example motors > 3 kW, contactors are gene -
rally used. Contactor relays are governed by the provisions 
of IEC 60947-5-1, contactors by those of IEC 60947-4-1.
Comprehensive criteria must be observed for their selec -
tion and use. These particularly include:• System and operating conditions
• Operation functions and conditions
• Rate of operations and durability
• Protection against over-current and over-temperature
• Protection against over-voltage
• Special conditions of use
The manufacturers provide manuals containing com-
prehensive information on selection and engineering.
In the context of quantification in accordance with 
EN ISO 13849, the selection criteria for the lifetime will be 
considered briefly here. A distinction is drawn between 
the mechanical and electrical durability. The mechanical 
durability of a contactor is expressed by the number of 
operation cycles attained by the contactor without loading 
of the conducting paths. It is dependent upon the wear of 
the mechanical moving parts.
The electrical durability of switchgear is expressed by the 
number of operation cycles at the attainment of which the 
electrical contact elements are worn out. The electrical 
contact elements are stressed during operation under 
electrical load, during both the contact making and brea -
king processes. This causes wear of the contact members 
in the form of contact pitting. It varies as a function of 
the voltage, current, load type (e.g. inductive) and dura -
tion. Complete contact pitting generally leads to contact 
welding. In applications relevant to safety, this must be 
detected, in order for hazardous states caused by failure 
of the contacts to open to be detected. For detection to 
be assured, mechanically linked contacts must be used 
on contactor relays, or mirror contacts on contactors. The 
manufacturer's information must be observed here.
The mechanical durability and the electrical durability of 
the contact elements are determined by the manufactu-
rers in test series. These values are however not indepen -
dent of each other. The actual durability of the contactor 
may depend upon the power and operating mode of the 
electrical load, as well as upon the mechanical wear. The 
durability of the device is influenced by these values.
The B10D values stated in Table D.2 of this report (see 
subclause D.2.4.1) for the durability of the device are for 
orientation only. Preference should be given to the values 
stated by the manufacturer. Should the manufacturer 
himself not state a B10D value, but state values (number 
of operation cycles) for the mechanical and electrical 
durability, the lower of these values (generally dependent 
upon the load in the case of the electrical durability) 
can be used as an estimate of the B10 value. The B10D can 
be ob tained by doubling of this value (see subclause 
D.2.4.1).\n270Annex D

If the following characteristics are satisfied, the MTTFD 
value for a single pneumatic, electromechanical or 
mechanical component can be estimated by means of the 
formulae shown further below:
• The manufacturer of the component confirms that the 
basic safety principles to EN ISO 13849-1:2012, Table B.1 
or Table D.1 were applied during design of the compo -nent (confirmation on the data sheet for the compo -
nent).
• The manufacturer of a component for use in a Category 
1, 2, 3 or 4 control system confirms that well-tried safety 
principles to EN ISO 13849-2:2012, Tables B.2 or D.2 
were applied during design of the component (confir -
mation on the data sheet for the component).\n271Annex D
• The manufacturer of the component specifies the sui -
table application and operating conditions for design 
of the SRP/CS and for the application. The designer 
of the SRP/CS satisfies the basic safety principles to 
EN ISO 13849-1:2012, Tables B.1 or D.1 for implemen -
tation and operation of the component and informs 
the user of his responsibility to satisfy the basic safety 
principles that he is required to implement. For the 
Categories 1, 2, 3 or 4, the same obligation applies with 
regard to satisfaction of the well-tried safety principles 
to EN ISO 13849-1:2012, Tables B.2 or D.2, and in turn 
during implementation and operation of the compo -
nent.
The actual measures behind the basic and well-tried 
safety principles are similar to those described above in 
greater detail for hydraulic components.The MTTFD value is defined as the mean time to dangerous 
failure. In order for this time to be determined for a com -
ponent, corresponding lifetime characteristics must be 
defined. Such characteristics may be the distances tra -
velled by pneumatic cylinders, the frequency of actuation 
of valves or electromechanical components, and stress 
reversal in the case of mechanical components. The reli -
ability of pneumatic or electromechanical components is 
generally determined in the laboratory.
D.2.4.1  Determining of the lifetime value B10D
The frequency of failure can be determined from values 
obtained in the laboratory or possibly in field studies, for 
example by means of Weibull  statistics [4]. The two-para -
meter Weibull  distribution function shown in Figure D.3 is 
more flexible than the exponential distribution, which it 
includes as a special case (b = 1).

Figure D.3:  
Illustration of the conversion  
from B10D to MTTFD
An increase in the failure rate following onset of the wear 
phase can be described well by b parameters > 1. The T 
parameter describes the characteristic life at which 63.2% 
of the components under consideration have failed. If only dangerous failures are considered, this can be 
presented by the “D” suffix. Alternative methods can be 
used to determine the Weibull  parameters, depending 
upon the test method. Such methods are also appropriate \n272Annex D
when data are incomplete, for example when intact parts 
are to be considered. Results in the form of data for the 
parameters b and T can be read off from the diagrams. In 
turn, the nominal life T10, at which 10% of the components 
studied have failed, can then be determined. The durabi -
lities of pneumatic and electromechanical components 
are generally stated in the pseudo-unit of (operation) 
“cycles” rather than in the dimension of time. The mean 
number of operations per year nop (in cycles per year, see 
subclause D.2.4.2) is used for conversion. The B10 value 
in cycles corresponds here to the time-based T10 value. 
The MTTFD value is determined as described below in sub -
clause D.2.4.2 by the nominal life B10. A reliability analysis 
employing Weibull  statistics can be conducted by means 
of commercial software. The safety-related reliability 
values for fluid power and electromechanical components 
must be stated by the manufacturer of the components 
concerned. The reliability of pneumatic components can 
be determined with reference to ISO 19973, Pneumatic 
fluid power – Assessment of component reliability by tes -
ting. This standard currently comprises five parts:
• Part 1: General procedures
• Part 2: Directional control valves
• Part 3: Cylinders with piston rod
• Part 4: Pressure regulators
• Part 5: Non-return valves, shuttle valves, dual pressure 
valves (AND function), one-way adjustable flow control 
valves, quick-exhaust valves
Where the reliability of pneumatic valves is determined, 
the life (B10 value) is indicated in cycles before failure. 
The nominal life B10 (termed t10 in some references) is the 
average number of operation cycles by the attainment 
of which 10% of the units studied have failed. Since in 
the case of valves, the “availability” failure criterion also 
encompasses failures that are not relevant to safety (e.g. 
leakage above the defined threshold), it has been set out 
in the standard that the value determined for the nominal 
life (B10) multiplied by two may be considered equal to the 
B10D (dangerous) value (number of cycles until 10% of the 
components fail dangerously):
B10D2 ⋅ = (D.2) B10
The B10 value is generally determined in the laboratory. For 
this purpose, at least seven valves produced at different 
times are subjected to endurance testing. The maximum 
rate of operations for the endurance test is determined 
from the pressure build-up (attainment of 90% of the test 
pressure) and the pressure dissipation (attainment of 
10% of the test pressure) in a connected volume that is 
defined according to the port cross-subclauses. At least five out of seven valves must fail for evaluation of the test 
results. The “maximum likelihood” and “rank regression” 
methods are stated in ISO 19973-1 as example methods 
for determining the Weibull  parameters.
As an approximation, where testing is performed on a 
small number of test specimens, e.g. seven valves, the 
first failure determines the B10 value, i.e. the number of 
cycles attained by the time of the first failure corresponds 
approximately to the B10 value. Should the first failure be 
dangerous, the number of operation cycles performed up 
to this point approximates to the B10D value.
Dangerous failures on pneumatic valves particularly 
include:
• Failure to switch (sticking at an end or zero position) 
or incomplete switching (sticking at a random inter   - 
  me diate position)
• Change in switching times
• Spontaneous change in initial switching position  
(in the absence of an input signal)
Analysis of the failures always refers to the entire modular 
unit, consisting for example of main valve and pilot valve.
D.2.4.2  Conversion of B10D to MTTFD
For the simplified method for estimation of a PL, the stan -
dard expects statement of an MTTFD value for considera -
tion of random component failures. For electromechanical 
and pneumatic components however, B10D are typically 
available, which must first be converted to MTTFD values. 
The standard provides an approximation formula for this 
purpose. This formula is subject to certain conditions:
T10DMTTFD=0,1  (D.3)B10D=0,1 · nop  
This approximation is based upon reformulation in two 
steps. The B10D value, stated in the pseudo unit of “cyc -
les”, is first converted to a T10D value. This value is the 
elapsed time at which 10% of the components under ana -
lysis have failed dangerously:
(D.4)nopB10DT10D=
The average number of actuations per year nop (stated in 
cycles per year) serves as the conversion factor for this 
purpose. It is based upon the following parameters, which 
must be estimated for the anticipated application (if 
appropriate, the worst-case scenario):\n273Annex D
• hop  → Mean operation in hours per day
• dop  → Mean operation in days per year
• tcycle → Mean operation time between the beginning  
        of two successive cycles of the component  
                  (e.g. switching of a valve) in seconds (s)   
                  per cycle.
The nop (in cycles per year) can be determined from these 
parameters as follows:
tcycledop · hop
nop□ =hs
· 3,600 (D.5)
The second step in the approximation hidden in the for -
mula (D.3) consists of the assumption of a “substitute 
failure rate” constant over time for the actual failure rate, 
of which wear is the dominant cause. This approximation, 
however, yields a result of adequate quality only up to 
attainment of the T10D value (which equates in “cycles” to 
the B10D value).
This part of the approximation is illustrated in Figure D.3. 
The unbroken curve represents the original Weibull  distri -
bution with an assumed shape factor of b = 3. In the parti -
cular case where b = 1, the Weibull  distribution transitions 
to an exponential distribution that is characterized by a 
constant failure rate over time. The dashed line now refers 
to the exponential distribution corresponding to the “sub -
stitute failure rate”, constant over time, which is equal 
to the reciprocal of the MTTFD value obtained by means 
of the formula (D.3). The MTTFD obtained by this means 
ensures that the exponential distribution shown by the 
dashed line intersects the original Weibull  distribution at 
the point (t = T10D ; FD = 10%). The point at which 10% of 
the components under analysis have failed dangerously 
is therefore reached by both distributions following elap -
sing of T10D. From Figure D.3, it can be seen that the actual 
fail ure rate prior to attainment of the wear phase is very 
low, and remains below the approximated exponential 
distribution up to point T10D. This approximation is there -
fore conservative (on the safe side). The importance of 
limiting the mission time to T10D is also evident: above this 
value, the proportion of dangerous failures which may 
actually be expected rises significantly over time when 
compared to the exponential substitute function. The 
validity of the approximation based upon the substitute 
failure rate constant over time can be extended by preven -
tive re placement of the affected component when the T10D 
value is reached.
In the lower part of Figure D.3, it can be seen clearly that 
the selected “substitute failure rate” λD = 1/ MTTFD of the 
exponential approximation corresponds approximately 
to the arithmetic mean of the failure rate which may actu -
ally be expected up to the point in time T10D. Beyond T10D however, the onset of the wear phase results in strong 
variation.
Formula (D.3) is derived from the condition 
F(T10D) = 1 – exp(– λD · T10D) = 10% 
for the exponential distribution forming the approxi-
mation, where λD represents the “substitute failure  
rate” referred to above. Reformulation produces  
λD = –ln(0.9)/T10D. Since ln(0.9) approximates closely to  
0.1 and MTTFD = 1/λD, the result is finally MTTFD ≈ T10D/0.1.
D.2.5  Good engineering practice methods
Should no component reliability data be available from 
the manufacturer, the standard proposes the use of 
values listed within it as the first alternative. It provides 
support in the form of typical values for mechanical, 
hydraulic and pneumatic components and for electro-
mechanical safety components frequently used in 
practice. These values are listed as MTTFD values or B10D 
values in Table D.2. The B10D value, which is obtained by 
the component manufacturer by testing, indicates the 
average number of cycles at which 10% of the compo -
nents have failed dangerously. This value can be used to 
estimate the MTTFD value. A number of conditions must 
however be met when the values in Table D.2 are used:
• The manufacturer of the component confirms that basic 
safety principles to EN ISO 13849-1:2012 or the relevant 
standard (see Table D.2) were applied during design of 
the component (confirmation on the data sheet for the 
component).
• The manufacturer of a component that is to be used in 
a Category 1, 2, 3 or 4 control system confirms that well-
tried safety principles to EN ISO 13849-1:2012 or the 
relevant standard (see Table D.2) were applied during 
the design of the component (confirmation on the data 
sheet for the component).
• The manufacturer of the component specifies the sui-
table application and operating conditions for the  
SRP/CS designer and the user and informs them of  
their responsibility to satisfy the basic safety principles 
to EN ISO 13849-1:2012 during implementation and  
operation of the component.
• The designer of the SRP/CS and the user satisfy 
the basic and/or well-tried safety principles to 
EN ISO 13849-1:2012 for implementation and operation 
of the component.
Compliance with these requirements is to ensure that the 
application of basic and/or well-tried safety principles 
is assured from manufacture, through implementation, \n274Annex D
to routine operation of the component. The interface 
between the manufacturer, the designer of the SRP/CS 
and the user of the machine (operating party) is clearly 
 defined: the manufacturer must provide binding confir -
mation that the safety principles were observed during 
design, and must make all relevant information available 
concerning the conditions of use and operation. The 
de signer of the SRP/CS and the user of the machine 
(operating party) are in turn responsible for observing 
all safety principles concerning implementation and 
operation of the component. Provided these conditions 
are met, the typical values cited in Table D.2 can be 
used for calculation of the MTTFD, if applicable via the 
B10D. The MTTFD value of 150 years for hydraulic control 
components, the reasoning for which is stated above, is 
extended here to include mechanical components. This 
secondary value can be used when reasoning cannot be 
provided for a fault exclusion but when the use of  
basic/well-tried safety principles is assured. In addition, 
B10D values for electromechanical components are stated 
that can be converted to an MTTFD value in accordance 
with the procedure also described above involving the 
average number of actuations per year nop. 
All values in the table relate to dangerous failures only, 
as expressed by the “D” suffix. It has generally been 
assumed here that only half of all failures are dangerous. 
The third edition of the standard however deviated from 
this rule for “contactors with nominal load”, and the pro -
portion of dangerous failures (75% break faults or short-
circuits) stated in Table K.2 of the IEC 60947-4-1 product 
standard [5] was used for conversion. This leads to a 
reduced B10D value compared to that in the second edition 
of the standard, namely 1,300,000 rather than 2,000,000 
cycles. Consequently, the values stated here may well 
appear more optimistic than those indicated on manu -
facturers' data sheets, which relate to all fault types that 
could impair functionality in the sense of availability. On 
some electromechanical components, for example relays, 
contactor relays and contactors, the electrical load of the 
contacts is a major factor determining the B10D value, as 
is frequently confirmed by observations in the field. At 
low electrical load (typically resistive load), described by 
EN ISO 13849-1 as up to 20% of the rated value, substan -
tially better values are obtained. The mechanical rather 
than the electrical durability was assumed decisive in 
this case (see subclause D.2.4). Depending upon the type 
(resistive or inductive) and magnitude of the load, B10D 
values lying between the extremes stated here may be 
derived. For the position switches, guard-locking devices, 
emergency stop devices and pushbuttons, such as ena -
bling switches, listed in the table, the safety principle of 
direct opening action is generally a requirement for the 
electrical part. Between the second and third editions of 
the standard, certain changes took place for these com -
ponents in the good engineering practice method as a 
result of experience gained with application in the field. This topic will therefore be discussed separately in detail 
in subclauses D.2.5.1 to D.2.5.6 below.
By their nature, these approaches constitute major sim-
plifications of the actual, complex relationships. A very 
low load current in particular, combined with infrequent 
actuation, can for example lead to cold welding of elec -
trical contacts. These effects should however be avoided 
by the required application of basic/well-tried safety prin -
ciples. These principles include the suitability of both the 
mechanical and electrical component characteristics and 
their adaptation to the anticipated load.
D.2.5.1  Modelling of electromechanical compo -
nents (position switches, guard-locking 
devices, emergency stop devices, enab -
ling switches and pushbuttons)
It has been seen in practical application of the standard 
to date that considerable uncertainty exists regarding the 
modelling of electromechanical components. This can 
also be seen from the fact that the language between the 
two parts of the standard differs to some extent in this 
context: whereas the first part selects an approach invol -
ving B10D within the good engineering practice method 
(see Table D.2), the second part addresses possible fault 
exclusions. This is exacerbated by the fact that for many 
of these components, a clear distinction cannot be made 
between their mechanical and electrical parts. Conse -
quently, the requirements and information in both parts 
of the standard will first be presented below in general 
terms; a pragmatic modelling approach will then be pro -
posed for the various electromechanical components that 
draws primarily upon Part 1 of the standard. Part 2 can 
also be applied as an alternative; implementation often 
fails in practice however owing to the fact that complete 
fault exclusion for the mechanical and electrical part 
requires confirmation by the manufacturer – for example 
in the data sheet – or precise knowledge of the conditions 
of use. In practice, the two conditions are often not met.
What is stated in the standard? – Electro mechanical  
components in accordance with Part 1 of the standard
With the good engineering practice method introduced 
above, EN ISO 13849-1:2015 proposes that subject to 
satisfaction of the conditions set out below, the typi -
cal B10D values [S] for position switches, guard-locking 
devices, emergency stop devices, enabling switches and 
pushbuttons stated in Table D.2 may be assumed:
• Use of basic and well-tried safety principles in design, 
application and operation of the component (see Tables 
D.1 and D.2 to EN ISO 13849-2), and\n275Annex D
• The possibility of fault exclusion for direct opening 
action (contacts to IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K, characte -
rized in the conceptual circuit diagrams by →)
Manufacturer's data [M] should of course always be given 
preference over typical values stated in the standard. 
Regarding modelling, the standard states that the compo -
nents “ can be estimated as a Category 1 or Category 3/4 
subsystem depending on the number of electrical output 
contacts and on the fault detection in the subsequent  
SRP/CS. Each contact element (including the mechanical 
actuation) can be considered as one channel with a res -
pective B10D value. ”
Although this statement refers directly only to emergency 
stop devices and enabling switches, the principle can 
also be applied to other electromechanical components.
It appears at first glance inconsistent for single-channel 
or two-channel modelling to be determined by the num -
ber of electrical output contacts, despite the fact that 
fault exclusion for direct opening action can be assumed 
for mechanically linked contact elements. However, the 
statement that the B10D value of each channel is to apply 
to the contact element including its mechanical actuation 
shows this to be a strategy intended to present, in the 
simplest way possible, the complex interrelationship of 
mechanical and electrical elements in the electromecha -
nical components referred to. The focus lay here not upon 
the details of the electromechanical design, but upon a 
recipe that is as simple as possible:
• An electromechanical component employing one con -
tact element with direct opening action that satisfies 
the above conditions can be modelled as part of a Cate -
gory 1 subsystem. In the functional channel, the subsys -
tem contains a block with the corresponding B10D value.
• An electromechanical component employing (at least) 
two contact elements with direct opening action that 
satisfies the above conditions can be modelled as part 
of a Category 3 or 4 subsystem, depending upon fault 
detection in the downstream SRP/CS. In each of the two 
functional channels, the subsystem contains one block 
with the corresponding B10D value.
Beyond the general case, EN ISO 13849-1 adds that “ in 
some cases it may be possible, that the machine builder 
can apply a fault exclusion according to EN ISO 13849-2, 
Table D.8 considering the specific application and envi -
ronmental conditions of the device. ”. The formulation of 
fault exclusion for an electromechanical component is 
therefore on the one hand an issue for the component 
manufacturer, who alone is familiar with the detail of its 
mechanical design. At the same time, it must be consi-
dered with respect to the application whether fault exclu -
sion is permissible in consideration of ambient, operating and application aspects. These are special cases in which 
the machine manufacturer excludes certain faults on a 
case-by-case basis for specific applications in consulta -
tion with the component manufacturer.
What is stated in the standard? – Electro mechanical  
components in accordance with Part 2 of the standard
Table D.8 of EN ISO 13849-2 applies to switches, such 
as electromechanical position switches and manually 
operated switches, and can therefore be applied to all 
the electromechanical components referred to above. The 
following conditions are stated for exclusion of the fault 
“failure of contacts to open”:
• The switch must satisfy IEC 60947-5-1:2003, Annex K, 
i.e. it must possess contact elements with direct ope -
ning action.
• Fault exclusion applies only up to a maximum of PL d.  
PL e requires redundant components, i.e. a second 
(position) switch (exception: emergency-stop devices).
This yields, irrespective of the number of electrical contact 
elements, the following result for position switches (with 
and without separate actuator), guard-locking devices, 
enabling switches and pushbuttons:
• Up to PL d: fault exclusion is permissible and may also 
apply to the mechanical aspects, subject also to con -
firmation by the manufacturer. Modelling as a Category 
3 encapsulated subsystem (with single-fault tolerance) 
and direct statement of PL d and PFHD of zero. The  
coupling between PL and PFHD must be cancelled for 
this purpose in SISTEMA (under Subsystem, “PL” tab).
• PL e: no fault exclusion (for mechanical and electrical 
aspects) is permissible 
For emergency stop devices in accordance with IEC 60947-
5-5, fault exclusion with respect to the “failure of contacts 
to open” is permissible for mechanical aspects up to  
PL e, provided a maximum number of actuations is con -
sidered. In the past, 6,050 actuations to IEC 60947-5-5 
was em ployed in this context as the number of operation 
cycles over the lifetime.
As mentioned in the preceding subclause, the permissi -
bility of fault exclusions in principle is of only limited rele -
vance in practice.
The requirements stated in the standard are applied 
below to frequently used electromechanical components.\n276Annex D
D.2.5.2  Position switches
Electromechanical position switches manufactured in 
accordance with IEC 60947-5-1 employing one or two 
electrical contact elements with direct opening action 
in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K can be consi-
dered as described in Table D.3. The B10D value that can be 
applied (to one or two channels) in accordance with the 
good engineering practice method is 2,000,000 cycles for 
position switches with separate actuator and 20,000,000 
cycles for all other position switches.
Positive actuation of the switch (e.g. the actuating 
mechanism, attachment of the actuator) is important, as well as the switch itself. The relevant requirements 
of EN ISO 13849-2, Annex A must also be satisfied for 
the requisite fault analysis, including of possible fault 
exclusions. In accordance with EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.8, 
a maximum of PL d is attainable with a single position 
switch (even with two contact elements). The relevant 
Type C standards for machines may contain provisions 
deviating from this, such as the use of two position 
 switches for Category 3.
Information on the selection and fitting of position 
 switches can be found in DGUV Informative publication 
203-079 [6] (in German).

D.2.5.3  Guard-locking devices
Guard-locking devices in this context are equipment for 
the mechanical blocking of closed guards, with integra -
ted position switch(es), considered as a modular unit, 
by means of which the safety functions of guard locking 
and interlocking (position monitoring of the safeguard) 
can be implemented. Of the “guard locking” safety func -
tion, only position monitoring of the locking element will 
be considered below. For discussion of the complete 
“guard locking” safety function, refer to subclause 8.2.19 
(Example 19). Besides the arrangement for monitoring 
the position of a guard, an interlocking device with guard locking also possesses a facility for blocking the moving 
guard in the closed position. As long as this facility is 
active, the guard cannot be opened.
A product standard for guard-locking devices does not 
exist; basic safety requirements are however listed in  
EN ISO 14119. The GS-ET-19E test principles [7] also govern 
guard-locking devices as modular units. According to 
these principles, electromechanical guard-locking devices 
contain a position switch for position monitoring of the 
safeguard (guard door) and a position switch for position 
monitoring of the locking element (see Figure D.4).\n277Annex D

If the guard-locking device uses the constructive element 
of a “faulty-closure protection”, the position switch for 
position monitoring of the safeguard is not required: if  
the locking element is in the locked position, it can be 
assumed that the safeguard is closed. If the locking  element is not in the locked position, no conclusion 
can be drawn regarding the position of the safeguard. 
Guard-locking devices can be considered as shown in 
Tables D.4 and D.5 in consideration of the requirements in 
EN ISO 14119 and the GS-ET-19E test principles.

The following can be summarized for guard-locking 
devices:
• The B10D value that can be applied (to one or two chan -
nels) for guard-locking devices in accordance with the 
good engineering practice method is 2,000,000 cycles. 
• The existence of the faulty-closure protection and the 
associated fault exclusion for the mechanical part must 
be confirmed by the manufacturer.
• A maximum of PL d can be attained by a single guard-
locking device as a modular unit for the interlock 
function (even with two contact elements per position 
switch) in accordance with EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.8.  
If a PL of e is desired, it can be attained only by means 
of an external additional position switch for position 
monitoring of the safeguard.
• On guard-locking devices in the form of modular units, 
the guard-locking function is limited to PL d, since only 
one position switch exists for monitoring of the locking 
element and for the associated actuating mechanism.
• The restrictions stated in the relevant Type C standards 
for machines must be observed.
Guidance on the selection and fitting of guard-locking 
devices can be found in DGUV Informative publication 
203-079 [6] (in German).D.2.5.4 Emergency stop device
Emergency stop devices constructed in accordance with 
the IEC 60947-5-5 product standard can be considered as 
described in Table D.6 (see page 279).
D.2.5.5  Enabling switches
Three-position enabling switches constructed in 
accordance with the IEC 60947-5-8 product standard or 
the GS-ET-22E test principles [8] can be considered as 
described in Table D.7 . Enabling switches are available 
with different contact sets (different numbers of make-/
break-contact elements). The safety-related cancellation 
of the enabling function is attained on three-position 
enabling switches by releasing the switch or pressing it in 
fully. The two functions can be evaluated in the same way; 
with respect to release of the switch however, particular 
attention must also be paid to overdimensioning of the 
electrical (in this case make) contacts with regard to the 
load. The functions of “releasing” and “pressing in fully” 
are grouped below in a single safety function, since the 
direction of actuation is not predictable.\n279Annex D

The IEC 60947-5-8 product standard places no design 
requirements upon the opening function. This applies to 
both the make- and break-contact elements (releasing 
of the switch or pressing in fully). In particular, electrical 
contact elements with direct opening action to IEC 60947-
5-1, Annex K are not required. They are not therefore well-tried components in this case, and Category 1 is conse -
quently not possible.
The GS-ET-22E test principles set out particular design 
requirements, for example:\n280Annex D
• For the “releasing” function: the use of well-tried 
springs, or a two-channel arrangement with contact 
monitoring
• For the “pressing in fully” function: electrical contact 
elements with direct opening action to IEC 60947-5-1, 
Annex K, or two-channel signal transmission with  
corresponding monitoring by the control system.
Design in accordance with GS-ET-22E provides safety com -
parable to that of a well-tried component.
Two-position enabling switches implement only the 
“releasing” safety function, and are not therefore con-
tained in the IEC 60947-5-8 product standard. Where they 
satisfy the GS-ET-22E test principles, the same evaluation 
applies as in Table D.7 for make contacts of the three-
position enabling switches: single-channel in Category 1 with a maximum PL of c, or two-channel in Category 3 with 
a maximum PL of d.
D.2.5.6  Pushbuttons
Pushbuttons to EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.8 are used for 
example for initiating a movement of limited duration or 
distance in inching mode. In this application scenario, 
they are always engineered as make-contact elements; 
the safety function is however dependent upon reliable 
opening of the make contact following actuation (com -
parable with the basic safety principle of de-energization 
(closed-circuit principle) to EN ISO 13849-2, Table D.1). The 
same analysis applies here as for the “releasing” function 
of a two-position enabling switch. Here too, particular 
attention must be paid to overdimensioning of the electri -
cal contacts with respect to the load.

For inching mode, Type C standards for machines often 
require an emergency-stop device in the vicinity of the 
pushbutton. Should the make contact fail to open fol -
lowing release of the pushbutton/inching button, the 
hazardous movement can be halted by actuation of the 
emergency-stop device. In addition, inching mode is often 
permitted only for a limited distance or duration, and/or 
with the SLS safety function (safely limited speed) activa -
ted. These measures cannot be quantified during determi -
ning of the PL (for example by means of SISTEMA), since 
they are dependent upon intentional action. It is therefore advisable for consideration to be given to the specific 
supplementary requirements for inching mode stated in a 
Type C standard when the PLr is set.
Prevention of unintended start-up must also be con -
sidered: this leads to the need for control devices to 
EN 60947-5-1 to be used, even for the two PL b variants 
in Table D.8, for example in order to exclude the short-
circuiting of adjacent contacts that are isolated from each 
as per Table D.8 of EN ISO 13849-2.\n281Annex D
For higher risks (PL c or d), control devices to IEC 60947-
5-1 are not sufficient, since they satisfy only Category B 
owing to their potential failure to open. “Safe” pushbut -
tons, such as two-stage enabling buttons to GS-ET-22E, 
are a suitable alternative. Versions of these pushbuttons 
with one make contact are suitable for use up to PL c, two-
channel versions up to PL d.
D.2.6  MTTFD of electronic control components
As already mentioned, declaration of the failure rates 
λ and λD, for example in the form of FIT values (failures 
in time, i.e. failures in 109 component hours), has long 
been normal practice for electronic components. It is 
therefore very likely that reliability information can be 
obtained from the manufacturer. These data may possibly 
have to be converted to MTTFD values, for example with 
the aid of the simplifying assumption that only 50% of 
all failures are dangerous. If manufacturers' data are not 
available, reference can be made to a number of known 
data bases. The following are cited by way of example in 
EN ISO 13849-1:

• Chinese Military Standard, GJB/z 299B & 299C  
In addition to these collections of data, a number of soft -
ware tools are available on the market that provide auto -
mated access to these or other databases. In the majority 
of databases, electronic components are catalogued by 
component type and other criteria (e.g. design, material, enclosure). Generally, base failure rates are stated in the 
first instance for reference conditions (e.g. for a compo -
nent ambient temperature of 40 °C and nominal load). 
Where the actual conditions of use differ, these rates 
can be corrected by means of adjustment factors. Tables 
C.2 to C.7 of the standard even list values taken from the 
SN 29500 database for certain typical electronic compo -
nents. In the third edition of the standard however, the 
columns present in the previous version, in which a safety 
margin of 10 (worst case) was implied, have been deleted. 
Provided the data sources are applied correctly, an additi -
onal safety factor is not generally required. Adjustment to 
stresses outside the reference conditions is not explicitly 
required by the standard, and should be applied with a 
sense of proportion in the interests of simplicity.
D.3  Integration of components and equip-
ment that have already been certified
Manufacturers are increasingly stating an MTTFD for their 
components on the data sheet. For components intended 
for use as subsystems in an SRP/CS, the manufacturer 
states a PL to EN ISO 13849-1 or an SIL to IEC 61508, 
IEC 62061 or IEC 61800-5-2, combined with statement 
of an average probability of dangerous failure per hour 
PFHD (PFH to IEC 61508). Should such components be 
employed in one channel of the SRP/CS only, the stated 
probability of failure per hour ( PFHD) may be considered as 
a substitute for the rate of dangerous failure (see formula 
D.6). Internal component characteristics such as redun -
dancy and self-diagnostics are already considered in this 
case. More detailed information on this aspect can be 
found in Chapter 2 of SISTEMA Cookbook 4 [9].
PFHMTTFD1 1≈ =
λD(D.6)   (“Black -Box” components with  
   PF HD within one channel )D
D.4  Parts count method
Once the MTTFD values of all safety-related components 
are known, the MTTFD of each block must first be calcula -
ted from them. This step can be performed in close detail 
by an FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis, Annex B); 
ideally, however, the different failure modes of each 
safety-related component and their effect upon the block 
must be analysed for this purpose. In consideration of 
the effort, this approach is therefore generally worthwhile 
only for components with a high failure rate, i.e. a low 
MTTFD value. An alternative that can be performed quickly 
and yields values that on average are not appreciably 
poorer is the parts count method stated in EN ISO 13849, 
Part 1. Essentially, this method is a summation with two 
chief assumptions:
• Irrespective of the failure mode of a component and its 
effects upon the block, all failures are divided into two 
halves, safe and dangerous. This means that half of the \n282Annex D
failure rate λ of a component contributes to the dange -
rous failure rate λD of the associated block. If the propor -
tion of dangerous failures, λD, within the failure rate as a 
whole has already been determined for the component, 
the same λD value is also allowed for the block.
• The dangerous failure rate λD of the block is then formed 
by summation of the λD contributions of all N safety-
related components present in the block concerned (the 
contributions of identical components can simply be 
grouped):  
 
 ∑
==N
ii D
121λ λ ∑
==N
iDi D
1λ λ   or (D.7)         
Since, as described above, the standard assumes con -
stant failure rates, the λD failure rates can be converted 
to MTTFD values simply by formation of the reciprocal. 
Based upon this relationship, the MTTFD value of a block 
can easily be derived from the MTTFD values of its com -
ponents. An example of application of the parts count 
method can be found in Chapter 6.
D.5  Series arrangement of blocks in a 
channel and capping of the MTTFD
If MTTFD values or λD failure rates are available for each 
block, the MTTFD for each channel can also be calculated 
in accordance with formula (D.7) by summation of the fail-
ure rates of all blocks involved in a channel. It is assumed 
in this case that the dangerous failure of any block in the 
chain of blocks constituting a channel is also to be treated 
as a dangerous failure of the channel. Since under certain 
circumstances however, downstream blocks are capable 
of detecting a dangerous failure of upstream blocks, this 
assumption constitutes an estimation erring on the safe 
side. The capping rule of the standard takes effect in this 
phase of determining the MTTFD: with the exception of 
Category 4, each MTTFD of a channel that mathematically 
exceeds 100 years is routinely reduced to the maximum 
value of 100 years. In Category 4, the cap is 2,500 years. 
The purpose of this rule is to prevent the component reli -
abilities from being overstated in comparison with the 
other dimensions relevant to the PL, such as the architec -
ture, tests and common cause failures.
D.6  Symmetrization of multiple channels
As soon as a control system involves two channels (as 
is generally the case for Categories 3 and 4) exhibiting 
different MTTFD values, the question arises as to which of 
the MTTFD values for each channel is to be used for deter -
mining the PL with the aid of the bar chart. For this issue, 
too, EN ISO 13849-1 has the answer in the form of a simple 
formula:/uni239F/uni239F/uni239F/uni239F
/uni23A0/uni239E
/uni239C/uni239C/uni239C/uni239C
/uni239D/uni239B
+− + =1 11
32
MTTFDC2MTTFDC1MTTFDC2MTTFDC1MTTFD(D.8)
The average MTTFD per channel is thus produced from the 
MTTFD values of the two redundant channels C1 and C2 by 
means of an averaging formula (this formula can be deri -
ved mathematically by calculation of the MTTFD value for a 
two-channel system without diagnostics but with known 
MTTFD values of both channels – MTTFDC1 and MTTFDC2 [5]). 
This completes the successive grouping of the MTTFD 
values of all components involved in the control system. 
The result is a value for the typical reliability of the com -
ponents present in the control system, without conside -
ration of the redundancy, diagnostics or CCF (common 
cause failures, cf. Annex F). Given that the MTTFD is already 
capped to 100 years (2,500 years in the case of Category 
4) for each channel involved, assignment of the MTTFD 
values to one of the three classes, “low”, “medium” or 
“high”, is expedient only after symmetrization. The sym -
metrized value is substituted in the numerical calculation 
of the PL as a parameter in addition to the Category, the 
average diagnostic coverage and the measures against 
common cause failure. Depending upon the Category to 
be attained, a minimum MTTFD value of three years (for 
Category B, 2 and 3) or 30 years (for Category 1 and 4) is 
also required.

Determining of the diagnostic coverage ( DC)
 
Changes with respect to the second edition  (BGIA Report 2/2008e):
• Reference inserted to possible reduction of the DC by cascading, e.g. of electromechanical position switches
• Two DC measures deleted from Table E.2: redundant shut-off path without monitoring of the actuator, and redundant shut-off path with monitoring of one of the actuators by either logic or the test equipment
• Figure E.3 amended
• Conditions amended for the simplified method in Category 2 (testing upon demand as an alternative to testing 100 times as frequently as demand; test chan-nel at least half as reliable as the functional channel, instead of MTTF
D,L ≥ 0.5 · MTTFD,TE)
• Examples inserted from the standard concerning fault detection in the process
 
The diagnostic coverage DC is a measure of the effec -
tiveness of a control system's self-test and monitoring 
measures. It may relate to individual components, blocks, 
or entire subsystems ( DCavg). The precise definition of the 
DC is based upon the division of failures into three groups 
(see Figure E.1):
• Safe (S) failures: these failures automatically result in 
a safe state being assumed that does not give rise to 
any hazards (example: a contactor remaining open or 
a valve remaining closed, resulting in interruption of 
energy and consequently stopping of potentially hazar -
dous movements).
• Dangerous detectable (DD) failures: these potentially 
dangerous failures are detected by test or monitoring 
measures and transferred to a safe state (example: fail-
ure of a contactor to open or of a valve to close, which is 
detected by a readback contact or position monitor, and 
handled safely).
• Dangerous undetectable (DU) failures: these potentially 
dangerous failures are not detected (example: undetec -
ted failure of a contactor to open or of a valve to close, 
as a result of which a demand for a safe torque off does 
not result in stopping of a hazardous movement).
On multi-channel systems, the term “dangerous failure” 
is used with regard to a single channel, although a dange -
rous system failure need not necessarily yet have occur -
red. The failures “DD” and “DU” can be combined to form 
the group of dangerous failures (D). The safe failuresFigure E.1:  
Illustration of the diagnostic coverage  
SDDDU
) (
DU DDDDDC
λ λλ
+=∑∑
may also be detectable or undetectable; the distinction 
is irrelevant, however, since the safe state is assumed in 
both cases.
The diagnostic coverage ( DC) is determined by the pro -
portion of detectable dangerous failures (DD) among all 
dangerous failures (D), and is generally stated as a per -
centage. For calculation of the DC, for example in conjunc -
tion with an FMEA (failure mode and effects analysis, see 
Annex B), the ratio is calculated of the totals of the failure 
rates λDD and λD of the unit under consideration. The DC is 
seen here to be a value relating to the tested unit (e.g. the 
block) and not to the test equipment. In order to simplify 
calculation of the DC, EN ISO 13849-1 offers an alternative 
solution to the FMEA: it proposes DC key values for typi -
cal diagnostics measures, the attainment of which may 
be assumed when the relevant measure is implemented 
correctly. In this way, evaluation from tables of the dia -
gnostics measures implemented per unit is sufficient. 
A similar procedure is frequently used by test bodies as 
standard and economic practice. 
Since the proportion of dangerous undetectable failures 
(i.e. 1 – DC) is the relevant value for the probability of 
failure for evaluation of the implemented test and moni -
toring measures, selection of the key values (60, 90 and 
99%) for formation of the four DC quality stages (Table E.1) 
is self-explanatory.
Table E.1:  
The four levels of diagnostic coverage in accordance with the 
simplified approach of EN ISO 13849-1  
DC (level of diagnostic coverage)
Description Range
None DC < 60%
Low 60% ≤ DC < 90%
Medium 90% ≤ DC < 99%
High 99% ≤ DC\n286Annex E
A fundamental distinction must be drawn between the 
DC of an individual test for a certain component or block, 
and the average diagnostic coverage DCavg  for the entire 
subsystem under analysis of a safety-related control sys -
tem (SRP/CS). The formation of groups by means of the 
key values is applied here both for qualification of the 
individual tests, and for definition of the DCavg. Since DCavg 
is one of the input variables for the simplified bar-chart 
method for quantification of the probability of failure, 
the calculated DCavg value is rounded down to the next 
lowest of the four key values (0, 60, 90 and 99%) from 
Table E.1, and thereby placed in one of the four DC classes 
(None, Low, Medium and High). For example, a DCavg value 
of 80% is reduced in the simplified approach to a value 
of 60% (in contrast to the procedure in the IFA SISTEMA 
software utility, which employs intermediate DCavg values 
in its default setting; see Annex H). The DC of individual 
tests will first be discussed below, followed by calculation 
of the DCavg. Table E.2 shows typical test and monitoring measures for 
components (usually elements or blocks), and evalua -
tion of their DC to EN ISO 13849-1. Different measures are 
usual for each function (I, L, O, i.e. input, logic, output), 
Category and technology. Their evaluation may vary as 
a function of the design or external factors, such as the 
application in which the control system is operated. In 
some applications, indirect monitoring by displacement 
transducers or position switches on the actuators rather 
than on the control system elements may for example not 
provide any indication of whether the safety function can 
still be executed independently by each of two redundant 
control channels. In general, evaluation as a numerical DC 
value makes no distinction between automatic tests (e.g. 
program routines that are performed regularly) or delibe -
rate tests (e.g. tests initiated manually by the operator at 
regular intervals); refer here also to subclause 6.2.14.

Which unit performs a test is in principle also irrelevant, 
for example in the case of self-tests. Only where appro -
priate independence is assured (single-fault tolerance, 
resistance to common cause failures) between the testing 
and tested units, however, is a test actually effective. It 
is also important that the safe state is actually assumed 
following detection of a dangerous failure. If, for example, 
contact welding on a main contactor is detected, but no 
means exist for timely stopping of a hazardous move -
ment, the detection is useless and must be rated with a 
DC of 0%.
With regard to the DC measure of “fault detection by 
the process”, the third edition of the standard provides 
information in the form of examples: “ The DC measure 
‘fault detection by the process’ may only be applied if the 
safety-related component is involved in the production 
process, e.g. a standard PLC or standard sensors are 
used for workpiece processing and as part of one or two redundant functional channels executing the safety func -
tion. The appropriate DC level depends on the overlap 
of the commonly used resources (logic, inputs/outputs 
etc.). E.g. when all faults of a rotary encoder on a printing 
machine lead to highly visible interruption of the printing 
process, the DC for this sensor used to monitor a safely 
limited speed may be estimated as 90% up to 99%. ” For 
PLr = e, this measure is not sufficient on its own (see Table 
E.2), and produces a red warning message when SISTEMA 
is used. Where adequately justified however, for example 
by means of further DC measures acting upon the same 
block, or when the complementary block of the redundant 
channel implements a different DC measure with a DC at 
least as great as the assumed DC provided by the process, 
this measure may still be included in the analysis. In 
 SISTEMA, this can be achieved by direct input of the DC 
with manual selection of the percentage step, accompa -
nied by documentation of the justification.

 \n290Annex E
The following requirement applies, in addition to the test 
and monitoring measures stated in Table E.2: should a DC 
of “medium” or “high” be required for the logic, at least 
one measure with at least 60% must be selected in each 
case for variant memory, invariant memory and proces -
sing unit. Measures other than those stated in Table E.2 
may also be employed. 
Further information on determining the DC for typical test 
measures can be found for example in Tables A.2 to A.14 
of IEC 61508-2 [1]. These tables contain the key values of 
60, 90 and 99% as the maximum DC to be attained by the 
relevant measure. With suitable unrestricted implemen -
tation of the measures stated, this maximum value can 
however generally be employed for estimation. Annex E of 
EN ISO 13849-2 [2] describes a comprehensive example 
of validation of the failure behaviour and the diagnostic 
measures on an automatic assembly machine.
Following determining of the DC for individual test meas-
ures and prior to calculation of the DCavg, the DC value per 
block must be determined. An individual test measure 
generally acts upon an entire block (e.g. cross monito -
ring): the discrete value can then simply be adopted for 
the block. Further permutations exist, however:
• If a block is monitored by a number of individual meas-
ures (see Figure E.2), the block DC is at least as good as 
the best individual DC. Should the measures mutually 
complement each other, a higher block DC may even be 
possible; this DC however must then be determined by 
analysis of the failures covered by each test, similar to 
an FMEA.
• A block consists of several units, each of which is tes -
ted by different measures, for example programmable electronics with separate tests for the memory and the 
processing unit (see Figure E.3). The block DC is then at 
least as good as the poorest individual DC. (Whether the 
occurrence of units without testing is permissible must 
be determined with reference to the relevant Category 
definition, see subclauses 6.2.5 to 6.2.7; the DC for the 
logic is subject to further requirements, see above.) A 
better and more precise value for the block DC can be 
attained by weighting the individual DC value with the 
associated failure rate λD (= 1/ MTTFD). Formula (E.1) can 
also be used for this purpose as an averaging formula at 
block level. Depending upon the accuracy, such an ana -
lysis also ultimately leads to an FMEA, however.
• Where components are cascaded, such as electro -
mechanical position switches connected to a safety 
module by a common conductor, it may lead to a reduc -
tion in the DC. An electrically two-channel arrangement 
enables certain faults of a position switch to be detec -
ted by the safety module from logically implausible 
signals from the two electrical contacts. Starting of the 
machine for example is prevented following closing of 
the door on which the switch is defective. If, in addition 
to the door on which the position switch has failed 
dangerously, a further door is opened, fault detection 
is (depending upon the sequence) not possible. Casca -
ding thus leads to a reduction in the DC; this is depen -
dent upon factors including the number of guard doors 
and the frequency with which they are opened. Details 
of such constellations and of estimation of the DC for 
them can be found in ISO/TR 24119 [3]. Subclause 6.1 of 
this standard excludes PL e for cascading. If, as shown 
in Example 28 (see subclause 8.2.28), an additional 
contact is employed for fault detection for each position 
switch, fault detection is also not restricted for casca -
ding, and PL e is attainable.

Where the DC is averaged for several units 
of one block, weighting of the individual 
DC values of 60% and 99% with λD leads to 
a different value (90%) than for example 
the unweighted arithmetic mean (79.5%)
The average  DC for an SRP/CS (at subsystem level) is 
termed DCavg and is calculated from the DC values for all 
blocks in functional channels. In contrast to the MTTFD 
per channel, no distinction is drawn between the control 
channels; rather, an overall value is determined directly. 
The averaging formula weights the individual DC values 
with the associated failure rate λD (= 1/ MTTFD) of each 
block. This ensures that blocks with a high failure rate, i.e. 
a low MTTFD, are given greater consideration than blocks 
the dangerous failure of which is comparatively unlikely.

The summation extends over all relevant blocks with the 
following provision:
• For blocks with no DC, a DC of 0% is substituted. These 
blocks thus contribute only to the denominator of the 
fraction. Whether the absence of diagnostics for blocks 
is consistent with the requirements of the Category con -
cerned must be determined on a case-by-case basis. 
Category 2 imposes the generic requirement of “check 
of the safety function(s)”, Category 3 fault detection 
“whenever reasonably practicable”, Category 4 also 
requires detection of an individual fault and only “if this 
detection is not possible” that the safety function is 
also to be performed in the event of an accumulation of 
undetected faults.• For blocks with fault exclusion for the dangerous failure 
mode (an imperceptibly low failure rate λD or infinitely 
high MTTFD), the corresponding value is omitted from 
the numerator and the denominator.
• All blocks that execute safety functions in the various 
functional channels are considered. Blocks that have 
the function of testing only are not considered. For 
Category 2 structures, this means that blocks of the test 
channel (“TE” and “OTE”) are not counted. In Category 3 
and 4, the average value is formed directly across both 
channels; symmetrization is not performed separately 
per channel as it is for the MTTFD.
For a detailed analysis of the influence of the tests upon 
the probability of failure of the overall system, further 
variables must be considered in addition to the DC. 
These include, in addition to the test rate, the failure 
rate of the test equipment itself, for example. In multi-
channel systems however, the frequency of a test is of 
lesser consequence, since the relevant intervals are 
generally considerably smaller than the MTTFD values of 
the channels. Consequently, several channels must fail 
before the impairment of a test becomes relevant to the 
system, which is very unlikely as long as the test cycles 
continue to be much smaller than the MTTFD of a channel. 
Subclause 6.2.14 provides more comprehensive expla -
nations concerning the required test rate. In Category 2 
structures however, failure of the test equipment turns a 
single-channel tested system into a single-channel untes -
ted system. The next dangerous failure in the functional 
channel can then no longer be detected and leads directly 
to performance of the safety function no longer being 
possible. In addition to requirements for the DC, further \n292Annex E
conditions therefore apply for the simplified assessment 
of the probability of failure of Category 2 systems:
• All test rates must be at least 100 times (in exceptional 
cases, at least 25 times) greater than the demand rate 
upon the safety function; alternatively, in the event of 
testing immediately upon demand  of the safety func -
tion, testing should be performed so quickly that the 
safe state is reached before a hazard arises. This is to 
ensure that a failure can be detected by a test before a 
demand of the safety function cannot be met (see also 
Annex G).
• The MTTFD of the test channel (TE and OTE) must be 
at least half as high as the MTTFD of the functional 
channel (I, L and O). This assumption ensures that the 
probability of failure of the test channel is not unac -
ceptably high. Should this condition be violated (even 
after capping of the MTTFD of the functional channel to 
100 years), it is of course permissible to calculate the 
probability of failure using an MTTFD of the functional 
channel that is reduced mathematically to double the 
MTTFD of the implemented test channel.References

Common cause failure (CCF)
Changes with respect to the second edition  
(BGIA Report 2/2008e):
Text of the descriptions of the measures brought into 
line with the third edition of the standard
The term common cause failure (CCF) describes the fact 
that in a redundant system or a single-channel system 
with separate test channel, several channels may be dis-
abled by one and the same cause. The desired single-fault 
tolerance of a redundant structure is thus negated. It is 
therefore important that this source of faults be elimina -
ted as far as possible. The triggers of CCFs may be physical 
in nature, such as overtemperature or strong electromag -
netic interference, or systematic, such as defective circuit 
design or programming errors where identical software is 
employed for both channels.
A common strategy for quantification of a control system's 
susceptibility to CCF is the beta-factor model. This stra-
tegy assumes that a certain proportion of the dangerous 
failures in one channel share the same cause as dange -
rous failures in the second channel. This concept is illus-
trated in Figure F.1: the dangerous failure rates for the two 
channels (shown symbolically as elliptical areas) have a 
CCF overlap, which is shown by the hatching. The propor -
tionality factor between the CCF rate and the dangerous 
failure rate of the single channel λD is normally termed β 
(common cause factor or beta factor).

It is virtually impossible to calculate the beta factor pre -
cisely for a specific control system, particularly since this 
should be done at the beginning of the actual design 
process. IEC 61508-6 [1] employs a points system for this purpose by which β values of between 0.5 and 10% can 
be determined. Points are assigned in a long list of meas-
ures sorted according to different causes; when certain 
rules are applied, the sum of these points results in an 
estimated β value. EN ISO 13849-1 takes up this method, 
both in simplified form and with adaptation to machine 
safety. Simplification is based upon technical measures 
that experts have considered particularly useful for the 
avoidance of CCF. This is, however, a compromise that can 
be justified empirically, but not scientifically:
• The list of measures against CCF was focused upon 
the relevant solutions, primarily technical in nature, in 
machine safety.
• A single target value with a maximum of 2% was selec -
ted instead of several possible β values. The target 
value can only be either attained or not attained. The 
simplified method to EN ISO 13849-1 for determining 
the Performance Level is based upon an assumed beta 
factor of 2%.
• The mathematical rules for the points system were 
summarized in two steps: each measure can only be 
either satisfied completely (full number of points) or not 
satisfied (zero points); no provision is made for propor -
tional numbers of points for measures that are not com -
pletely satisfied. If measures (such as diversity, use of 
well-tried components) are satisfied completely only in 
individual SRP/CS in the form of subsystems, different 
packages of measures may act against CCF at subsys -
tem level. The minimum number of 65 points must be 
reached for the Categories 2, 3 and 4 in order for use of 
the simplified method for determining the Performance 
level to be permissible. A maximum of 100 points can 
be reached.
The following points must be observed during evaluation 
of the measures:
• The measures must be evaluated with particular 
consideration for their effectiveness against CCF. For 
example, the product standards already require immu -
nity to environmental influences and electromagnetic 
interference. Supplementary evaluation must be per -
formed of whether these influences have been effec -
tively minimized as sources of common cause failures.
• The physical counter-measures differ according to the 
control technology employed: of the environmental 
influences, for example, electromagnetic interference is 
more relevant in the case of electrical control systems, \n294Annex F
whereas contamination of the fluid is more relevant in 
the case of fluid control systems. Counter-measures 
must therefore be evaluated with consideration for the 
technology employed.
• The tested structure of Category 2 systems constitutes a 
special case. In this case, CCF concerns common failure 
of both the functional channel and the test channel. A 
common cause failure results in the structural benefit 
being negated. The evaluation of the measures must 
be adjusted accordingly to the particular aspects of the 
Category 2 structure.
• The full number of points may be credited for a measure 
against common cause failures that cannot occur owing 
to the inherent characteristics of the control system.
The measures against common cause failures and the 
associated numbers of points from EN ISO 13849-1 are as 
follows:
• Separation/segregation (15 points): physical separation 
between the signal paths, e.g.:
 – Separation in wiring/piping
 –  Detection of short-circuits and open circuits by  
  dynamic testing
 –  Separate shielding for the signal path of each  
  channel
 –  Sufficient clearances and creepage distances on  
  printed-circuit boards
• Diversity (20 points): different technologies/design or 
physical principles are used. Examples include:
 –  One channel electronic or programmable electronic,  
  the other electromechanical hard-wired
 –  Different initiation of the safety function for each  
  channel, for example by means of position, pressure  
  or temperature
 –  Digital and analogue measurement of variables  
  (e.g. distance, pressure or temperature)
 –  Sourcing of components from different manufac-  
  turers
• Design/application/experience: protection against 
overvoltage, overpressure, overcurrent, overtempera -
ture, etc. (15 points) and the use of well-tried compo -
nents (5 points)• Assessment/analysis (5 points): a failure mode and 
effects analysis has been performed for each part of 
the SRP/CS, and its results taken into account during 
design for the avoidance of CCF
• Competence/training (5 points): training of designers in 
understanding the causes and consequences of CCF
• Environmental conditions concerning protection against 
adverse influences upon electrical/electronic and fluid 
power systems (25 points):
 – Electrical/electronic systems: prevention of  
  contamination and electromagnetic disturbances  
  (EMC) in accordance with appropriate standards
 – Fluid power systems: filtration of the pressure  
  medium, prevention of dirt intake, drainage of  
  compressed air, for example in compliance with the  
  component manufacturer's requirements for purity of  
  the pressure medium
On combined fluid power and electrical systems, both 
aspects should be considered.
• Environmental conditions with regard to other influen -
ces (10 points): consideration of the requirements for 
immunity to all relevant environmental conditions, such 
as temperature, shock, vibration, humidity (for example 
as specified in the relevant standards)

What is the significance of the bar chart in Figure 5 of EN ISO 13849-1?
 
Changes with respect to the second edition  (BGIA Report 2/2008e):
• Reference to Note 1 in Annex K of the new standard
• Explanations from subclause 4.5.4 of the standard of the time aspects during testing brought into line with the new standard
• Explanations inserted concerning extension of the mission time beyond 20 years

Unlike its predecessor, EN 954-1 [1], EN ISO 13849-1 makes 
provision for demonstration of a Performance Level (PL) in 
addition to examination of the Category. The Performance 
Level is determined numerically, as shown in Table 6.1 of 
this report, from the average probability of a dangerous 
failure per hour ( PFHD) of the system (cf. Footnote 4 in 
Chapter 3, Page 15). This value must be determined from 
the system structure, the failure rates of the components, 
the level of diagnostic coverage provided by automatic 
testing, the mission time of the system, and in the case of 
relevant system structures, the sensitivity of the system to 
CCF (common cause failure).
Mathematical models are employed for this purpose  
that take account of the combined effect of the stated 
factors and return the result in the form of the PFHD (as 
an average value over the mission time). In theory, a 
custom model should be created for each system under 
analysis when the standard is applied. For some common 
structural variants, the “designated architectures” of 
EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 6.2, (cf. subclauses 6.2.1 to 
6.2.7 of this report), Markov  models have been developed 
at the IFA the numerical results of which are compiled 
in the form of a bar chart in subclause 4.5.4, Figure 5 of 
the standard (Figures 6.10 and G.1 of this report). This 
dispenses with the need for development of a dedicated 
mathematical model and for complex calculations, pro -
vided the system essentially shares the form of one of 
the designated architectures, or can be broken down into 
system parts that do so (cf. in this context subclause 6.3 
and Annex H of EN ISO 13849-1, or subclause 6.4 of this 
report). A basic introduction to the Markov  modelling 
technique can be found for example in [2].For a comprehensible diagram to be obtained, certain 
restrictions and simplifications are necessary. Firstly, the 
standard limits the number of designated architectures 
and therefore also the number of necessary models. 
Secondly, the large number of input parameters has been 
reduced by intelligent grouping. For this purpose, the 
values MTTFD and DCavg were introduced, each of which 
groups several input parameters.
The MTTFD used in the diagram represents a mean time to 
failure of each channel in its dangerous failure mode. The 
MTTFD values of several function blocks are grouped here 
to form a single channel MTTFD (Chapter 6 and Annex D). 
All MTTFD values are based upon the assumption of con -
stant component failure rates λD, hence MTTFD = 1/λD. 
In a two-channel structure with different MTTFD values 
between channels, an averaged substitute MTTFD value is 
employed. Conversely, the DCavg represents the weighted 
average value of the diagnostic coverage for the entire 
system; this value is used for assignment to one of the 
four DCavg levels (see Table 6.4).
The meaningfulness and permissibility of this grouping 
within the required quantification accuracy have been 
demonstrated by comprehensive test calculations. The 
same applies to the relationship, permitted in sub -
clause 4.5.4 of the standard, between the MTTFD values 
of the test and functional channels in the Category 2 
architecture: the MTTFD of the test channel must be at 
least half the MTTFD of the functional channel. Finally, a 
requirement is imposed for redundant structures that 
common cause failures be reduced to an appropriate 
level: no more than 2% of the dangerous failures may 
have a common cause. This must be demonstrated in 
each case during application of the standard by means of 
a simple estimation method (Annex F).
The Markov  models upon which the bar chart in EN ISO 
13849-1 (and Figure G.1 of this report) is based take 
account of operation of the systems under underlying con -
ditions that are realistic for machinery. They assume that 
the systems:
• Are subject to at least to one demand of the safety func -
tion per year 
• Assume the safe “Operating inhibition” state in res -
ponse to automatic detection of an internal fault, and 
are then generally switched off manually shortly after -
wards (and at the latest after a few hours)\n296Annex G

• Are repaired or replaced and restored to service fol -
lowing assumption of the operating inhibition state, an 
accident or detected dangerous failure
Under these underlying conditions, the quantitative tar -
get value for modelling, the PFHD, represents the average 
number per hour of demands upon the safety function 
that are not met owing to failure. Where demands are 
made continually upon the safety function (continuous 
mode of operation), it indicates the number of dangerous 
system failures per hour. For Category 2, a requirement is 
that testing is fully effective. This can be attained by an 
adequate relationship between the test and demand rate 
or by an adequately fast response to a fault (cf. subclause 
6.2.14). Since the PFHD determined in this way considers 
only random failures and not systematic failures and other 
negative effects, it must be regarded as a theoretical per -
formance value that denotes the safety quality of a design 
but does not permit conclusions for example regarding 
the frequency of accidents. This PFHD is the mathematical quantity indicated on the vertical axis of the bar chart 
(cf. Figure G.1).
Despite consideration being given in principle to 
demands upon the safety function and to repair, the 
absolute values for the demand rate and the repair rate 
(the reciprocal of the repair time) have only a negligibly 
small influence upon the PFHD in this sense. Only for the 
designated architecture for Category 2 must testing at a 
frequency substantially higher than that of the demand 
of the safety function be made a requirement (alterna -
tively: testing takes place immediately upon demand 
and the times for fault detection and safe response are 
together shorter than the specified system response 
time; cf. EN ISO 13849-1, subclause 4.5.4). The standard 
proposes a test rate that is at least 100 times that of the 
demand rate. Even down to a ratio of 25 : 1, however, the 
PFHD increases only by approximately 10%, which can 
be  allowed for by a correction factor of 1.1 (cf. Note 1 in 
Annex K of the standard). This ratio in the rates avoids 
an unacceptably high impairment of diagnostics caused \n297Annex G
by insuffi ciently frequent performance of the test. For the 
Categories B, 1, 3 and 4, the influence of the demand rate 
upon the PFHD is negligibly low. The PFHD values deter -
mined from the diagram for the Categories B, 1, 3 and 
4 therefore apply to any demand rates and any (mean) 
repair times. For values of less than one demand per year, 
the bar chart provides an estimation erring on the safe 
side. For Categories 3 and 4, the PFHD values are valid for 
adequately high test frequencies (see explanations in 
subclause 6.2.14).
Should the mission time of an SRP/CS exceed 20 years, 
the PFHD values determined by means of the simplified 
method (Annex K of the standard) are generally no longer 
valid. Under certain circumstances, this situation can 
however be addressed within the simplified procedure 
with a few improvements. Two possible scenarios exist:
• In the first scenario, the SRP/CS is specified from the 
outset for a mission time exceeding 20 years. The influ -
ence of the longer mission time can then be estimated 
erring on the safe side from the Markov  models upon 
which Annex K of the standard is based, as follows: for 
every five years' extension of the mission time beyond 
20 years, a further 15% is added to the PFHD for Cate -
gories 2, 3 and 4 (Categories B and 1 require no adjust -
ment of the PFHD). The simplified method and SISTEMA 
can therefore still be used. This is conditional upon 
constant failure rates, irrespective of the mission time. 
For parts subject to wear, this means that the parts 
must be designed for the specified longer mission time 
TM (T10D ≥ TM), or each part must be replaced preventively 
upon expiration of T10D.
• In the second case, the SRP/CS was originally designed 
for a mission time of 20 years, but is now to be used 
beyond this duration. The deterioration in the PFHD anticipated from the Markov  modelling can then be esti-
mated as described in the first case with addition of  
an allowance. The situation is critical where the  
SRP/CS contains wearing parts or components that 
deteriorate over age; these typically include “chemical” 
components (e.g. “wet” electrolytic capacitors, batte -
ries, electrochemical sensors), mechanical components 
(such as brakes, clutches), electromechanical compo -
nents (such as switches, relays, contactors), fluid power 
components (such as valves), and certain optical com -
ponents (such as optocouplers). In this case, the user 
of the machine (operating party) is generally unable to 
assess whether all its components are also designed for 
an extended mission time, or what measures, such as 
preventive replacement of individual parts, proof tes -
ting, etc., must be performed. Extension of the mission 
time – with addition of the allowance stated above to 
the PFHD – is possible only when manufacturer's infor -
mation is available on the measures to be taken when 
the mission time is extended, and only conditional 
upon these measures being implemented by the user 
(operating party).
The columns for Category B and 1 in Figure G.1 were cal -
culated by means of a model that considers the demand 
of the safety function, and the repair. The PFHD values 
for these Categories can however be approximated very 
well by the simple relationship PFHD ≈ λD = 1/ MTTFD. 
This means simply that the PFHD of the single-channel 
un tested system ( DCavg = 0) corresponds practically to its 
dangerous failure rate.
For the other Categories, however, a more complex 
me thod of calculation is required. The essential modelling 
method is explained below with reference to the example 
of the "designated architecture" for Category 2. This struc -
ture is shown again in Figure G.2.

Five function blocks are present, of which the blocks I 
(input), L (logic) and O (output) execute the safety func -
tion proper in a logical series arrangement. Block L tests 
blocks I, O and itself in conjunction with the function 
block TE (test equipment). The function block OTE (output 
of TE) is capable of initiating a safe state in the event of 
failure of the main I-L-O channel. The additional function 
blocks TE and OTE, which are not directly essential to the 
function, thus constitute a form of substitute channel 
for the fault case. Unlike a “true” second channel, this 
sub stitute channel becomes active only when faults are 
detected in the main channel.
The state graph in Figure G.3 can be derived from the 
safety-related block diagram in Figure G.2. To this end, all 
25 = 32 failure combinations of the five function blocks 
are first formed. The state without failure is the OK state 
shown above. It is followed by a series of states in which 
only one function block has failed, then by a series in 
which two blocks have failed, and so on. The denotation 
of the states consists of the names of each failed function 
block followed by “D”, indicating that the block concerned 
has failed dangerously (i.e. unfavourably in safety terms). 
Failures of function blocks cause consequential states to 
be reached, indicated here by arrows. States in which the 
system is no longer capable of performing the safety func -
tion are shown in grey. In cases where the failure can be 
detected and a safe response is therefore possible, a tran -
sition exists to the “Operating inhibition” state shown on the left-hand side. Of the 32 failure combinations, those 
in which the system has failed dangerously and undetec -
tably (to itself) are grouped together for simplification of 
the model. This collective state, denoted “System DU” 
(dangerous undetectable), is shown on the right. It can be 
attained from several states as a consequence of the fail-
ure of function blocks. The “Hazardous situation/harm” 
state can be seen at the bottom of Figure G.3. This state is 
attained if and only if a demand is made upon the safety 
function from within dangerous previous states (shown 
in grey). Like the “Operating inhibition” state, this state 
is also transitioned to the OK state by repair. Further tran -
sition arrows, for example from “OK” to “System DU”, are 
the result of simultaneous, common cause failure (CCF) of 
multiple function blocks. It is assumed in 2% of the dan -
gerous failures of either of the function blocks L and TE, 
the other of the two blocks fails dangerously for the same 
reason. The same is assumed for the function blocks O 
and OTE.
All arrows are assigned to transition rates the dimension 
of which is determined by the transition processes con -
cerned (failures, tests, demands, repairs). Consideration 
of common cause failures (CCFs) at different points also 
results in a change in the original transition rate. For the 
purpose of calculation of the bar chart, the worse case is 
assumed in which the test equipment employed in the 
system is itself not tested. For this reason, a rate of zero is 
assigned to some transitions in Figure G.3.

Systems that do test their test equipment are therefore 
estimated erring on the safe side. For the purpose of sim -
plified calculation by means of the Markov  method, it is 
assumed that all transition processes are characterized by state residence periods that are distributed exponentially, 
even though this holds true, strictly speaking, only for the 
constant-rate random failures. Separate considerations 
justify this simplification.\n299Annex G
It is assumed that at the beginning of the mission time, 
the probability of the system being in the OK state is 1 
and the probability of all other possible system states is 
0. During the assumed mission time of 20 years, all state 
probabilities gradually change: beginning at the OK state, 
they are redistributed along the transition arrows. The 
sum of the state probabilities remains constant at 1. This 
also results in a migration over time to the “Hazardous 
situation/Harm” state, of which the average value with 
respect to time over the 20-year mission time is represen -
ted by the PFHD, i.e. the average probability of a dange -
rous failure of the system per hour.
This PFHD value is shown on the vertical axis of the 
bar chart for the different “designated architectures” 
in accordance with subclause 6.2 of the standard (cf. 
subclauses 6.2.3 to 6.2.7 of this report); Categories 2 
and 3 are subdivided further according to the average 
diagnostic coverage ( DCavg). The columns are created by 
variation of the MTTFD, i.e. the mean time to dangerous 
failure of the (or a) functional channel, for a combination 
of the architecture (or the associated Markov  model) and 
the DCavg. The Markov  model in Figure G.3 can for example 
be used to calculate the two columns for the designated 
Category 2 architecture. (For mathematical reasons, an 
equivalent substitute model differing from this model was 
used in practice. This model is not presented here, since 
its relationship to the block diagram in Figure G.2 is less 
transparent. The substitute model delivers virtually iden -
tical results.) The other columns are based upon further 
Markov  models that were also developed in accordance 
with the principles described above for the corresponding 
designated architectures.
The PFHD intervals were assigned the Performance 
Levels a to e on the logarithmic PFHD scale in accordance 
with Table 6.1. This is shown in Figure G.1, in which an 
additional PFHD scale has been added to Figure 5 of 
EN ISO 13849-1.
The PFHD interval from 10-6 per hour to 10-5 per hour has 
a particular peculiarity: it is mapped to the two adjacent 
Performance Levels b and c. Division of the logarithmic 
scale in the middle places the boundary between Perfor -
mance Levels b and c at the geometric mean of 10-6 per 
hour and 10-5 per hour, specifically at √10 ⋅ 10-6 per hour 
≈ 3 ⋅ 10-6 per hour. The assignment of PFHD intervals and 
Performance Levels is largely consistent with IEC 61508-1, 
Table 3, and IEC 61508-5, Figure E.2 (see [3; 4]).Annex K of the standard contains the content of Figure G.1 
in numerical form in Table K.1. Table K.1 can be used to 
determine the Performance Level more precisely than 
is possible by means of the figure; this is particularly 
useful when the PFHD contributions of several cascaded 
subsystems require summation. Conversely, the bar chart 
pro vides, above all, a swift overview of the suitability of 
various technical solutions for the PL, and can therefore 
be used to make a preliminary selection. The information 
in Table K.1 of the standard is also contained in the “Per -
formance Level Calculator” (PLC), a convenient card disc 
available from the IFA that can be used to determine the 
PL [5].
Occasionally, the DCavg value determined for a system 
may lie only marginally below one of the thresholds “low” 
(60%), “medium” (90%) or “high” (99%). If the simplified 
quantification method in EN ISO 13849-1 is then applied, 
purely formal constraints require that the next-lower DCavg 
level, i.e. “none”, “low” or “medium”, be used. This pro -
cedure constitutes an estimation of the system erring on 
the safe side. Owing to the small number of graduations 
on the DCavg scale, however, a minor change to the system 
that has the effect of causing the DCavg value to dip just 
below one of the thresholds may result in a substantially 
poorer assessment of the system. This can even occur 
when components with high-quality testing (a high DC) 
in a channel are replaced by superior components (with 
a higher MTTFD) (cf. the DCavg formula for example in sub -
clause 6.2.14). The minor improvement in the channel 
MTTFD is then over-compensated for by the formal down -
grading of the DCavg to the next lower level, as a result of 
which a poorer (i.e. greater) PFHD value is determined. 
This effect, which appears paradoxical, is a consequence 
of the coarse division of the DCavg scale, i.e. ultimately of 
the simplicity of Figure 5 (Table K.1) of the standard (cf. 
Figure G.1 of this report).
This effect can be prevented or ameliorated by use of a 
graph with a finer scale for the DCavg values (Figure G.4) 
in place of Figure G.1. In consideration of the limited 
accuracy of DCavg values (cf. EN ISO 13849-1, Table 6, 
Note 2), the minimum possible DCavg values were also 
considered for all Categories. The IFA “SISTEMA” software 
utility (see Annex H) can be used to determine the PFHD. 
SISTEMA even interpolates between the columns shown 
in Figure G.4. Generally, a major downgrading of the DCavg 
can thereby be avoided, and a PFHD value often obtained 
that is both more precise and superior.\n300Annex G

SISTEMA: the software utility for evaluation of SRP/CS
H.1 What is SISTEMA capable of?
The SISTEMA software utility (SISTEMA is the German 
acronym for safety of control systems on machines) pro -
vides developers and testers of safety-related machine 
controls with comprehensive support in the evaluation of 
safety in the context of EN ISO 13849-1. The tool, which 
runs on Windows, enables the structure of the SRP/CS 
to be modelled based upon “designated architectures”, 
and ultimately permits automated calculation of the reli -
ability values at various levels of detail, including that of 
the attained Performance Level (PL) and the probability of 
failure ( PFHD).
Relevant parameters, such as the risk parameters for 
determining the required PÜerformance Level (PLr), the 
Category of the SRP/CS, the measures against common 
cause failure (CCF) on multi-channel systems, the mean 
time to dangerous failure ( MTTFD) and the diagnostic 
coverage ( DC) of components and blocks, are entered 
step by step in input dialogs. Once the required data have 
been entered into SISTEMA, the results are calculated and 
displayed virtually instantly: each parameter change is 
reflected immediately on the user interface with its impact 
upon the entire system. Users are for the most part spared 
time-consuming consultation of tables and calculation 
using formulae (calculation of the MTTFD by means of 
the parts count method, symmetrization of the MTTFD for 
each channel, estimation of the DCavg, calculation of the 
PFHD and PL, etc.), since these tasks are performed by the 
software. This enables parameter values to be varied and effects of the changes assessed with little effort. The final 
results are summarized in a report, which can be printed 
out.
H.2 How is SISTEMA used?
SISTEMA processes basic elements from a total of six 
hierarchical levels: the project (PR), the safety function 
(SF), the subsystem (SB), the channel (CH)/test channel 
(TE), the block (BL) and the element (EL). The relationship 
 between them is shown briefly below (Figure H.1).
The user first opens a project, in which the machine or 
hazard zone that is to be analysed in greater detail can be 
defined. Safety functions are then assigned to the project. 
The safety functions can be defined and documented, 
and a PLr assigned to them. The PL actually attained by 
the parameterized SRP/CS is determined automatically 
from the subsystems which – in a series arrangement 
– execute the safety function. Each subsystem is based 
upon a “designated architecture” from the standard, as a 
function of the selected Category. The architecture deter -
mines, among other things, whether the control system 
is of single-channel, single-channel tested or redundant 
design, and whether a special test channel must be consi -
dered during evaluation. Each channel can be subdivided 
in turn into any desired number of blocks, for which either 
an MTTFD value and a DC value are entered directly, or – 
on the lowest level in the hierarchy – the values for the 
individual elements of which the block is composed.

User-friendly library functions complete SISTEMA's range 
of features. Many manufacturers of components provide 
libraries of their products' data. Links to these libraries 
can be found on the IFA's website (www.dguv.de/ifa, 
Webcode: e92603). Users can however create libraries of 
their own, in which they can store subsystems that they 
have developed themselves, or frequently used compo -
nents. Libraries can be stored either locally, or centrally 
on servers.
H.3 The SISTEMA user interface
The SISTEMA user interface is divided into four areas 
(see Figure H.2). The greatest part of the user interface is 
occupied by the workspace in the centre. Depending upon 
which view is active, the workspace contains an editable 
input dialog or a partial view of the overview document. 
The content of the active view is determined by the basic 
element selected from the hierarchy described above, 
which is selected from a tree view on the left-hand side. 
Each branch in the tree view represents one basic ele -
ment. Basic elements can be created, deleted, moved or 
copied on different levels in the tree view. The details of 
the selected basic element are entered in the input dia -log in the editing view. Each input dialog is further sub-
divided into different areas by tabs. The final tab in each 
input dialog contains a table summarizing all lower-level 
branches and listing the main information. If, for example, 
a block in the tree view is marked, this table shows all 
elements contained within the block, together with their 
MTTFD and DC values.
The tree view also shows status information for each 
basic element. The status information takes the form of 
a coloured marker adjacent to the branch. A red cross 
indicates that a condition of the standard is not satisfied, 
a limit value is exceeded, or that a required value cannot 
be calculated owing to a general inconsistency. A warning 
is output in this case. A yellow dot indicates the presence 
of a message (as for example when a basic element has 
not yet been assigned a name). All other basic elements 
are marked with a green tick. The colour marking is also 
always inherited by the branches higher up in the hierar -
chy, red having the highest and green the lowest priority. 
All warnings and information concerning the active basic 
element are displayed in the message window below the 
workspace.
Figure H.2:  
SISTEMA user interface
The area below the tree view shows the main context 
information for the selected basic element. This informa -
tion comprises the PL, PFHD, MTTFD, DCavg and number of 
CCF points of the higher-level subsystem, and the PLr, PL 
and PFHD of the higher-level safety function (this applies, 
of course, only to basic elements on lower hierarchy 
levels). The consequences of changes in the displayed 
parameters are thus displayed immediately.In addition to its flexibility, the SISTEMA user interface is 
notable for its ease of use and intuitiveness. Context help 
on the right-hand side is intended to facilitate the lear -
ning process.\n303Annex H

Operating mode selection safety function
I.1  Introduction
Work on a machine generally entails manual intervention 
in the danger zone, in addition to automatic operation. 
Since such intervention, required for example for setup, 
troubleshooting or cleaning, is generally associated with 
an elevated risk, different operating modes are employed 
depending upon the task to be performed. 
Selection of an operating mode activates safety functions 
on the machine that reduce the respective prevailing risk 
to an acceptable level. From a safety perspective, an ope -
rating mode is thus defined in terms of the safety func -
tions that are activated and those that are deactivated 
when the operating mode is selected. Errors in selection 
of the operating mode may lead to the required safety 
functions not being activated: if a different operating 
mode is activated to that selected, other safety functions 
are activated rather than those required for the planned 
task. In the worst-case scenario, an error in operating 
mode selection may even lead to no safety functions at all 
being active. The increase in the risk associated with the 
two cases necessitates a safety analysis of the operating 
mode selection.
Operating mode selection is normally implemented by 
electromechanical selector switches. The Machinery 
Directive [1] sets out a number of requirements for this 
purpose. For example: 
• A selector switch that can be locked in each position 
must be provided for operating mode selection 
• Activation of an operating mode must be unambiguous 
(i.e. each position of the selector switch must corres -
pond to only one operating mode)
• The selected operating mode must be clearly identi-
fiable by the operator (for example evident from the 
position of the selector switch)
The Machinery Directive permits substitution of the selec -
tor switch in the application by a different item of equip -
ment for selection that is able to restrict the use of certain 
machine functions to selected groups of persons. The use 
of electronic equipment for this purpose is not excluded; 
the circuits and components used that are relevant to 
safety, and any software that may be used, must however 
attain a level of safety comparable to that of an electro-
mechanical operating mode selector switch. Since an error in selection of the operating mode may 
lead to a direct increase in the risk, selection of the ope -
rating mode must be regarded as a safety-related func -
tion. It is also listed as such in Table 8 of the standard. 
This raises the question whether the control aspect of 
operating mode selection is part of each safety function 
implemented on the machine, or whether operating mode 
selection can be regarded as a safety function in its own 
right. As in the procedure described in subclause 5.3.2, 
in which overlapping hazards within a given danger zone 
can be divided into hazards presented by individual parts 
of the machine, it is expedient for operating mode selec -
tion to be treated as a safety function in its own right. This 
also prevents the components used for operating mode 
selection from further increasing the average probability 
of a dangerous failure per hour ( PFHD) in each individual 
safety function.
As stated in the introduction, an operating mode is cha -
racterized in safety terms by the safety functions that are 
activated by its selection. Accordingly, the safety function 
of operating mode selection can be defined as follows: 
activation of the safety functions required for the selected 
operating mode.
It must now be determined how the required Performance 
Level PLr of the operating mode selection function is to be 
set. In some cases, the PLr of operating mode selection 
is already stated in the product standard used. Where 
this is not the case, it is logical for the highest PLr of all 
safety functions that can be activated on the machine to 
be applied. This rule is based upon the fact that failure 
of the operating mode selection function can result in 
the required safety functions not being activated, or – in 
a worst-case scenario, when operating mode selection 
fails altogether – the machine being operated unnoticed 
with no safety functions whatsoever. When a machine 
tool is changed from the “setup” to the “process monito -
ring” operating mode, for example, this could lead to an 
un acceptable increase in the risk.
When operating mode selection is treated as a safety 
function in the sense of EN ISO 13849-1, the standard also 
becomes relevant for evaluation of the control technology 
employed. Depending upon the components used and 
the scenario, fault exclusions could be asserted. This pro -
cedure will be described below for common control ele -
ments used for operating mode selection. Further infor -
mation on operating mode selection as a safety function 
can be found in subclause 4.1 of [2].\n306Annex I
I.2 Cam-operated selector switches
On switches with direct opening contact elements to 
IEC  60947-5-1 [3], Annex K, fault exclusion for failure of 
the contacts to open can be applied in accordance with 
Table D.8 of EN ISO 13849-2 [4]. These switches also have 
the status of well-tried components; the safety function 
can therefore be classified as Category 1 in accordance 
with the standard when they are used.
If, on switches with direct opening contact elements, the 
fault exclusions are also possible for short circuit between 
adjacent isolated contacts and for simultaneous short cir -
cuit between the three terminals of changeover contacts 
in accordance with Table D.8 of EN ISO 13849-2, these 
component faults need not be assumed. For example, on 
a two-channel electrical circuit, fault exclusion permits 
modelling as a Category 3 subsystem and implementation 
up to Performance Level PL d in the single-channel mecha -
nical components (refer in this context also in IFA Report 
4/2018e, Annex A, Example 8 [2]).
Fault exclusions cannot be asserted for PL e; additional 
measures are required in this case. It is possible for 
example for the operator of the machine to be required to 
confirm the selected operating mode following display on 
a user interface. At the same time, an activation system 
(see subclause I.3) in the safety-related control in PL e is 
to ensure that at any given time, no more and no less than 
one operating mode is selected on the machine. 
I.3  Electronic equipment
Fault exclusion is not possible on electronic equipment. A 
further analysis is therefore required for fault analysis of 
operating mode selection by means of electronic equip -
ment.
For this purpose, it must first be established which ope -
rating mode selection functions must be modelled by the 
selection equipment. Analysis reveals the following sub-
functions:
1) Access to the operating mode selection function
2) Selection of the operating mode
3) Activation of the operating mode
On an operating mode selection arrangement engineered 
by means of electronic equipment, the sub-functions sta -
ted can be implemented in three subsystems (Figure I.1) 
[5]:Figure I.1:  
Structure of the operating mode selection function
   Access system Selection system Activation system
Access system
The access system is the part of the operating mode 
selection function that restricts the facility to select the 
operating mode to certain groups of persons and prevents 
actuation of the selection system inadvertently or impro -
perly. Since selection of each operating mode is associ -
ated with the activation of different safety functions, the 
access system is considered relevant to safety.
On electromechanical selection equipment, access is 
implemented by means of a key. Mechanical coding of the 
key can be used to limit the selection to specific operating 
modes. This measure is accompanied by organizational 
measures that have the purpose of limiting access to the 
key(s) to certain groups of persons. 
On electronic selection equipment, access can be imple -
mented for example by means of an RFID (radio-frequency 
identification) key or by passwords and corresponding 
organizational measures. For analysis of the safety, 
assessment is necessary of whether the access restric -
tions exhibit safety comparable to that provided by a key 
on electromechanical selection equipment (integrity of 
the access data, coding, copy protection, organizational 
measures, etc.). The access system does not therefore 
need to be considered during determining of the probabi -
lity of failure of the safety function.
Selection system
The selection system determines the operating mode that 
is to be activated by the activation system in the control 
system (see below).
On electromechanical selection equipment, the selection 
system corresponds to the manually actuated switch 
knob, the position of which is transmitted mechanically, 
for example via a shaft and cams, to the electrical contact 
elements. As described above, fault exclusion permits 
safety implementation up to PL d and with the application 
of additional measures up to PL e on such equipment.
On electronic selection equipment, the selection system 
is generally implemented by means of a user interface 
(human-machine interface, HMI), for example employing a 
touchpad or membrane keyboard. The operator specifies 
the operating mode to be activated in the machine control \n307Annex I
through the user interface and where applicable further 
electronic components. Since standard components are 
generally employed for this purpose, classification of a 
selection system engineered in this way as PL c or higher 
is not generally possible in the first instance. One means 
by which the required safety can nevertheless be attained 
is described in subclause 4.6.4 of the standard, which 
states provisions concerning software-based parameteri -
zation. Since selection of the operating mode by an elec -
tronic selection system is equivalent to software-based 
parameterization, the safety of this selection system 
can be assessed against this subclause of the standard. 
The method described in subclause 4.6.4 encompasses 
selection of the operating mode by the operator, checking 
of the selected operating mode in the safe control sys -
tem, and confirmation of the selected operating mode by 
the operator. This ensures that the integrity of the data 
used for parameterization is maintained along the entire 
communication chain and that corruption is detected. In 
particular, should a fault occur in one of the components 
of the selection equipment, it is prevented from selecting 
or confirming an incorrect operating mode. 
Activation system
The actual safety function of operating mode selection, 
i.e. activation of the safety functions required for the 
selected operating mode, is performed on the activation 
system. Where electronic selection equipment is used, 
only the activation system is considered in quantifica -
tion of the operating mode selection when the selection 
system – as described above – is evaluated against the 
requirements of software-based parameterization.For the activation system, a PFHD is determined according 
to the control components used for this purpose that must 
yield at least the Performance Level PLr required for the 
operating mode selection function. 
Operating mode selection by means of electronic selec -
tion equipment is described below in further detail with 
reference to an example (Figure I.2).

operating mode.
I.4.2 Structure
The access system in the example takes the form of an 
electronic key system. The personal authorization level for 
access is stored on the electronic key. 
The selection system comprises three components: an 
HMI with touchscreen for displaying and selecting the 
operating modes available in the applicable authorization 
level, a safety PLC for checking the authorization level and 
the selected operating mode, and a standard PLC for com -
munication between the components.

description)\n308Annex I
The safety PLC forms the activation system. It is res -
ponsible for changing the operating mode and thus for 
activating the safety functions required for the operating 
mode. The safety PLC also ensures that one operating 
mode and the associated safety functions are active at 
any given time.
I.4.3 Functional description
Key system/standard PLC 
Insertion of a key into the reader causes the authorization 
level to be read out. The authorization level defines, as 
a function of the technical qualifications of the operator, 
which operating modes the operator is to be entitled 
to select. The reader is connected to the standard PLC 
through a data interface. Once the key data have been 
read out, the authorization level is transmitted to the HMI 
(a) and the safety PLC (b). 
In addition to the data interface, the reader features a 
relay output that is switched off as long as no key is inser -
ted or the key data cannot be read out. The relay output is 
connected to a safe input on the safety PLC (c).
HMI
The operating modes to which the key provides entitle -
ment by virtue of the authorization level are displayed on 
the HMI. Following selection of an operating mode, it is 
transmitted via the standard PLC to the safety PLC (d). The 
safety PLC sends a feedback message regarding the saved 
operating mode over the same path back to the HMI, 
where it must be acknowledged by the operator.
Safety PLC
As soon as a signal change takes place on the safe input 
of the safety PLC following insertion of the key, a process 
is launched in the safety PLC at the end of which the 
selected operating mode is activated. The process com -
prises the following discrete steps:
1. The authorization level stored on the key is checked 
for its validity.
2. The operating mode selected on the HMI is then 
 checked for whether it constitutes a valid operating 
mode and the operator is authorized to select it based 
upon the authorization level.
3. The operating mode is signalled back to the HMI for 
acknowledgement (e).
4. Following acknowledgement of the operating mode, it 
is checked for its consistency with the operating mode 
actually selected. 5. The safety functions required for the operating 
mode are activated. 
I4.4 Safety analysis
The reader in this example satisfies the structural require -
ments for Category 3. This means that a single fault can -
not lead simultaneously to an incorrect output on the data 
interface and the relay output. Single faults are detected 
by high-quality coding of the authorization level, cross 
monitoring in the reader, and anticipation in the safety 
PLC. The reader combined with the electronic key serving 
as an access system thereby attains a level of safety com -
parable to that of the key of electromechanical selection 
equipment.
The process described for selection, checking and confir -
mation of the operating mode and programming of this 
process satisfy the requirements for software-based para -
meterization in accordance with subclause 4.6.4 of the 
standard.
The SRASW software of the safety PLC is programmed 
in accordance with the requirements for PL e and the 
guidance in subclause 6.3.
The safety PLC is a safety component for use in PL e.
The average probability of a dangerous failure of the ope -
rating mode selection safety function is derived from the 
PFHD for the activation system, which in the example is 
the safety PLC.

1 Current situation 
The	   analysis	   of	   discrete	   hazards	   is	   proven	   good	  
practice	  in	  safety	  technology.	  Probabilistic	  analysis	  
in	   accordance	   with	   EN	  ISO	  13849-­‐1	   or	   IEC 	  61508	  
[3,	  4]	  and	  IEC 	  62061	  and	  the	  risk	  assessment	  for	  a	  
hazard	  situation	  show	  however	  that	  consideration	  
must	  also	  be	  given	  to	  the	  overlap	  of	  hazards.	  The	  
paper	   [5]	   provides	   a	   basis	   for	   discussion	   of	   the	  
consequences	   of	   a	   probabilistic	   approach	   to	   the	  
analysis	   of	   overlapping	   hazards.	   The	   present	  
information	  sheet	  details	  and	  elaborates	  upon	  this	  
paper.	  
Owing	   to	   th e	   wide	   range	   of	   hazardous	   situations	  
encountered	   at	   the	   human -­‐machine	   interfaces	  
referred	  to	  above,	  this	  information	  sheet	  cannot	  be	  
considered	   universally	   valid	   for	   their	   analysis.	  
Standards	   developers	   are	   free	   to	   describe	  
appropriate	   machine-­‐ specific	   pro visions	   in	   the	  
relevant	  product	  or	  Type	  C	  standards	  and	  have	  the	  
remit	  to	  do	  so. 	  
Problematic	   in	   this	   context	   is	   that	   where	   a	   large	  
number	   of	   overlapping	   hazards	   arise	   at	   a	   human -­‐
machine	  interface,	  a	  sufficiently	  low	  probability	  of	  failure	   of	   all	   safety -­‐related	   control	   components	  
involved	  (sensors,	  logic,	  multiple	  actuators)	  can	  be	  
demonstrated	  only	  with	  very	  high	  analytical	  effort	  
(e.g.	  Markov	  modelling),	  if	  at	  all. 	  
Furthermore,	  overlapping	  hazards	  of	  differing	  risk	  
(differing	  in	  their	  PL
r	  or	  SIL)	  make	  dete rmining	  the	  
probability	   of	   failure	   of	   safety	   functions	   more	  
complex,	   which	   in	   turn	   drastically	   increases	   the	  
required	  analytical	  effort.

2 Handling of overlapping hazards in 
practice 
Precise	   examination	   of	   which	   hazards	   actually	  
overlap	  within	  a	  specific	  hazard	  zone	  is	  absolutely	  
essential.	  The	  dimensions	  of	  the	  parts	  of	  the	  body	  at	  risk	   and	   the	   proper	   actions	   on	   the	   part	   of	   the	  
machine	  operators	  must	  be	  considered,	  as	  must	  the	  
possible	   movements	   of	   the	   machinery	   parts	  
presenting	  a	  hazard	  (such	  as	  vectorial	  movements	  caused	   by	   the	   kinematics	   of	   multiple	   axes	   or	  translational	   movements	   of	   single	   axes).

(behind	  end	  panel) 	  \n315Depending upon the specific risk assessment, it is per -
missible in practice to model safety functions based upon 
an analysis of their discrete hazards, even though they 
are formed by overlapping hazards.
However, where several actuators (e.g. contactors, valves, 
closed-loop drive controls) contribute to reducing the risk 
of the same discrete hazard, they must all be considered 
together in a safety function. In other words, all actuators 
capable of causing hazardous movements on one and 
the same machine part must be considered together in a 
safety function.
When the individual risk assessment on the machine 
leads to a differentiated risk assessment with differing PLr 
or SIL, it is permissible in practice to model safety func -
tions based upon the analysis of discrete hazards.
Examples:
1. If the movement of a milling tool is derived from the 
kinematic interaction between multiple movements of 
discrete axes, all actuators triggering this movement 
must be grouped in a safety function. The resulting 
movement may for example be comprised of five 
discrete movements: three translational movements 
in the axes X1, Y1, Z1, one swivel movement B1 and one 
rotational movement S3 (see Figure 2, discrete hazard 
E2).
2. Movements of a single multi-axis robot must be 
 grouped in a safety function for analysis (multiple 
robots side by side are considered separately).
3. Multiple chucks that together hold an item (where a 
failure of one of the chucks results in the item no lon -
ger being held) must be grouped in a safety function.
With reference to Example 1, formulation of safety func -
tions from the discrete analysis can result in the analysis 
of the hazards presented by the drive axes as shown 
in Figure 2. The image shows, by way of example, four 
discrete hazards E1 to E4, marked by red circles, in the 
machining zone of a machine tool:
E1: Rotational (S1) and translational (C1, for off-centre 
machining) movement of the left-hand workpiece 
spindle
E2: Rotational (S3), translational (X1, Y1, Z1) and swivel (B1) 
movement of the milling spindle
E3: Rotational (S2) and translational (Z4) movement of the 
right-hand workpiece spindle
E4: Rotational (S4) and translational (X2, Z2) movement 
of a tool spindle (the turret toolholder is indexed; its rotational movement need not therefore be considered 
here)
These four discrete hazards thus yield the four safety func -
tions SF1 to SF4. The safety function SF1 for E1 for example 
comprises one feed axis and one spindle drive (C1, S1). The 
safety function SF2 for E2 for example comprises the feed 
axis drives X1, Y1, Z1, the swivel drive (B1) and the spindle 
drive (S3).
