A GUIDE TO THE  
MACHINERY  
REGULATION (EU)
2023/1230
Key changes and challenges  \nAs the “go to” document for machine builders, 
the European machinery directive lays 
out the minimum safety requirements for 
machinery.  The last change to the directive was 
on 29 December 2009, when 2006/42/EC was 
introduced. 
In 2020, as part of the commission work program ‘A Europe 
fit for the Digital Age’, the Machinery Directive underwent an 
impact assessment, and it was concluded that a number of gaps 
required addressing – namely (i) tackling new risks originating from 
emerging technologies; (ii) legal uncertainty on scope definitions; 
(iii) insufficient provisions for high-risk machines; (iv) adoption 
of digital documentation; and (vi) divergences in transposition 
interpretation.
As the implementation date draws closer, it is important for OEM/
machine builders to understand the key changes and challenges.
What is the impact on OEMs? 
For OEMs exporting or selling equipment in the EU this will replace 
the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC.  It highlights: 
•  A new compliance route
•  A revised structure to the annexes to improve the flow
•  Additional requirements added into the essential health and 
safety requirements 
• Digital documentation
• Cybersecurity requirements

The new Machinery Regulation (EU) 
2023/1230 was published in the 
official journal on 29 June 2023, 
and entered into force on 19 July 
2023, with a 42-month transition to 
the application date of 20 January 
2027. This date is the same for all 
EU and EFTA countries; and being 
a regulation and not a directive 
means it will be adopted at the same 
time with no modification. After 
20 January 2027, all machinery 
and related products will need to 
meet the requirements of the new 
regulation before being placed on  
the market. 
The key changes to the new 
machinery regulation include a 
reordering of the annexes from 
the current machinery directive 
2006/42/EC, a focus on changing 
technologies, and the threat from 
cybersecurity breaches. It is the first regulation to tie together 
machinery safety  and cybersecurity.JUNE 2023

Annex I now covers - Categories of machines or related products 
and has been split into Part A and Part B. 
•  PART A includes the addition of safety components and 
embedded safety systems with fully or partially self-evolving 
behaviour using machine learning approaches ensuring safety 
functions, a nod towards future solutions that may use AI 
technology.
•  PART B covers the majority of the current Annex IV machines 
in 2006/42/EC of the current machinery directive, with the 
exception of removable mechanical transmission devices, 
including their guards, guards for removable mechanical 
transmission devices, vehicle servicing lifts, and portable 
cartridge-operated fixing and other impact machinery, which 
are included in PART A.

PG 12\n7Annex III
Essential health and safety requirements 
(EHSRs)
This Annex has seen a number of significant additions including:
Ergonomics (Clause 1.1.6) gives consideration to how operators interact with machinery 
or related products that have either fully or partially self-evolving behavior.
Autonomous mobile machinery (Clause 3.6.3.3) gains extra requirements, which are 
included in annex III and the supplementary essential health and safety requirements to 
offset risks due to the mobility of machinery or related products.
Protection against corruption (Clause 1.1.9) introduces cyber security requirements 
related to OT (Operational Technology) and has been added to cover the increase in 
industrial networks for safety systems, and also the generation of data to support 
the growth of connected enterprise solutions. It covers both hardware and software 
requirements.
Machinery needs to ensure that the connection of another device – either locally or 
remotely – doesn’t lead to a hazardous situation. In addition, any hardware component 
that transmits signals or data and has access to software that is critical for the 
machinery’s compliance to relevant health and safety requirements, needs to be 
protected against both accidental or intentional corruption, and will collect evidence of 
both legitimate or illegitimate interventions.
Finally, for protection against corruption, software and data that are critical for the 
compliance of the machinery or related products with the relevant health and safety 
requirements, shall be identified as such and shall be adequately protected against 
accidental or intentional corruption. The machinery or related product shall identify the 
software installed on it that is necessary for it to operate safely; and shall be able to 
provide that information at all times in an easily accessible form. The machinery or related 
product shall collect evidence of a legitimate or illegitimate intervention in the software 
or a modification of the software installed on the machinery or related product or its 
configuration.

PG 12\n8Additional requirements have been included for control systems.
Safety and reliability of control systems (Clause 1.2.1)
Control systems shall be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent 
hazardous situations from occuring. They also should withstand where appropriate 
to the circumstances and risks, the intended operating stresses and intended and 
unintended external influences, including reasonably foreseeable malicious attempts 
from third parties leading to a hazardous situation.
It’s here that the link between safety and cybersecurity is evident. There is also the need 
for a tracing log containing the data generated in relation to an intervention, and of the 
versions of the safety software uploaded after the machinery or related product has been 
placed on the market or put into service. This needs to be enabled for five years after such 
an upload. 
The requirement here is exclusively to demonstrate the conformity of the machinery 
or the related product with this EHSRs should a reasonable request from a competent 
national authority be made.
For OEMs developing control systems or logic with fully or partially self-evolving behavior, 
that are designed to operate with varying levels of autonomy, additional requirements 
have been added into the EHSRs in Annex III.
They shall not cause the machinery or related product to perform actions beyond their 
defined task and movement space.
Recording of data on the safety related decision-making process for software-based 
safety systems ensuring safety functions must be enabled and retained for one year after 
the machinery or related product is place on to the market or put into service. At all times 
it must be possible to correct the machinery or related product in order to maintain its 
inherent safety.

modifications – 
explanation of 
Article 3 (16) 
After being placed on the market or 
put into service, should machinery be 
modified, by physical or digital means 
(meaning hardware or software), 
in a way that is not foreseen by the 
manufacturer, and which affects the 
safety of such products by creating a 
new hazard or increasing an existing risk, 
the modification should be considered 
as substantial when significant new 
protective measures are required . The 
person that carries out the substantial 
modification should be required to 
perform a new conformity assessment 
before placing the modified product on 
the market or putting it into service. This 
conformity assessment can be restricted 
to the part of the production line that has 
been modified, and so does not have to 
be completed for the whole assembly.

PG 12\nCompliance Route 
There is more emphasis in the regulation 
for third-party certification. However, self-
certification is still possible as long as the 
machinery is in Annex I Part B and is built 
preferably using harmonized standards or a 
common specification. If the machinery is 
not in Annex I, the preferred route is to follow 
harmonized standards. The compliance route for 
this type of equipment is in Annex VI module A.
For all other equipment, third-party certification 
through a notified body is required.
The route to compliance is covered in Annexes 
VII VIII & IX of the Machinery Regulation (EU) 
2023/12302.

Fines & Penalties
Article 50 empowers member states to define 
the exact size of the fines and penalties 
against the Machinery Regulations (EU) 
2023/1230. Although not yet confirmed it is 
expected that these will aligned with other 
recent directives, such as the Network & 
Information Security Directive (NIS2) which 
can impose fines of up to €10,000,000 or 2% 
of global annual revenue.
