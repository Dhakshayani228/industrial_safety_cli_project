Guarding 
Protection for WorkersProtection for Workers
Overview 
Each piece of machinery has its own unique mechanical and non-mechanical hazards. Machines can cause a variety of injuries ranging from minor abrasions, burns or cuts to severe injuries such as fractures, laceraƟons, crushing injuries or 
even amputa Ɵon. Machine guards 
are your ﬁrst line of defense 
against injuries caused by machine operaƟon. Each machine must have 
adequate safeguards to protect operators and other employees in the immediate work area from hazards created by ingoing nip points, rota Ɵng parts, sparks and 
ﬂ ying debris. 
Pinch points and shear points would include power transmission apparatuses such as: ﬂywheels, pulleys, belts, chains, couplings, spindles, cams, gears, connecƟng rods and other machine components that transmit energy. Having an understanding of how a machine works, and how the guards can protect you, will result in a reduced risk of injury. 
As an employee you may become 
accustomed to doing things in a certain way or have tasks ﬂ owing a 
certain way and grow oblivious to the hazards that may be ever present around your piece of equipment. With complacency there is a sense of numbness that develops to hazards. Employees must be on guard and not become complacent in the workplace. 
All guards should: 
PREVENT CONTACT  – machine 
guards must provide a physical barrier that prevents the operator from having any part of his/her body in the “danger zone” during the machine’s operaƟ ng cycle; 
BE SECURED IN PLACE – machine 
guards must be secure and strong so that workers are not able to bypass, remove, or tamper with them. 
CREATE NO NEW HAZARD  – A 
safeguard defeats its own purpose if it creates a hazard of its own such as a shear point, a jagged edge, or an unﬁnished surface which can cause a 
laceraƟon. If possible, one should be 
able to lubricate the machine without removing safeguards. NOT INTERFERE WITH THE MACHINE OPERATION – Any 
safeguard which impedes a worker from performing the job quickly and comfortably might soon be overridden or disregarded. Proper safeguarding can actually enhance eﬃciency since it can relieve the 
worker’s apprehensions about injury. 
Hazardous Mechanical Motions: 
HAZARDOUS MOTIONS – including 
rotaƟng machine parts, reciproca Ɵng 
moƟons (sliding parts or up/down moƟons), and transverse moƟ ons 
(materials moving in a con Ɵ nuous line); 
POINTS OF OPERATION – the areas 
where the machine cuts, shapes, bores, or bends the stock being fed through it; 
PINCH POINTS AND SHEAR POINTS 
–the area where a part of the body
or clothing could be caught betweena moving part and a sta Ɵ onary object.
There are also non-mechanical hazards that can injure machine operators or personnel working in the vicinity of machinery. These hazards include ﬂ ying splinters, 
chips or debris; splashes, sparks or sprays that are created when the machine is opera Ɵng. These hazards 
can be prevented through the use of machine guarding and wearing/ use of required personal protec Ɵve 
equipment (PPE).

There are ﬁve (5) general types of 
machine safeguards that can be used 
to protect workers and personnel in the immediate vicinity of machinery. 
1. Guards – these are physical
barriers that prevent contact.
They can be ﬁ  xed, interlocked,
adjustable, or self-adjus Ɵng.
2. Devices – these limit or prevent
access to the hazardous area.These can be presence-sensingdevices, pullback or restraintstraps, safety trip controls, two-hand controls, or gates.
3. Automated Feeding and Ejec Ɵon
Mechanisms – These eliminatethe operator’s exposure to thepoint of opera Ɵon while handling
materials.
4. Machine Loca Ɵon or Distance –
this method removes the hazardfrom the operator’s work area.
5. Miscellaneous Aids – these
methods can be used to protectboth operators and peoplein the immediate vicinity ofoperaƟng machinery. Examples
include shields to contain chips,sparks, sprays or other forms ofﬂying debris; holding tools thatan operator can use to handlematerials going into the point ofoperaƟon; and awareness barriers
to warn people about hazards inthe area.
