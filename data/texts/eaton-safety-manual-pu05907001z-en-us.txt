Your Eaton Industries GmbHDear reader,
In life it is often advisable to make compromises. However, this is not so 
when it comes to the subject of safety! Safety is always a fundamental 
basis for advancement and success both in the recreational sphere and at 
work. This particularly applies to the use of machines and plants.
We at Eaton know how much machine builders, operators and users 
depend on the continuous reliability and safe functioning of all 
components and systems. The machine should not present any hazards 
to persons at any time. For this reason, we develop and produce safety 
components that you can rely on, particularly when this is very important.
We are one of the largest manufacturers worldwide in the production of 
components for the safe emergency stopping of plants and machinery. Our 
emergency-stop pushbutton actuators and switching devices have been 
first choice for several decades, when it comes to establishing a safe state 
in the event of a hazard. Our future-oriented technologies includes the 
innovative  Safety control relay which combines standard functions 
with the safety-related monitoring and processing of machine signals. 
We can thus offer our customers a comprehensive range of products for 
functional safety with a very favorable cost-benefit ratio.Foreword\n2

1st stage: 
Avoid dangers
Eliminate and reduce
risk by design measures
during the planning and
development stage of
the machine.
2nd stage: 
Secure dangers
Reduce risk through the
use of the necessary
protective measures.
3rd stage: 
Indicated other 
dangers
Reduce risk through
notification / hazard
warning of residual risk
If the hazards cannot be prevented or sufficiently limited by means  
of design measures (step 1), safeguards must be provided in step 2  
by means of safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS). These  
must be designed and selected so that the probability of functional  
errors is sufficiently low. If this is not possible, any faults that occur  
must not lead to the loss of the safety function. In addition to the  
safeguards of the machine designer, the machine operator or user  
may require additional protective measures for reducing the residual  
risk (e.g. personal protective equipment, training etc.).Functional safety
During its entire life cycle – from manufacture to disassembling – a 
machine poses danger to man, machine and the environment. It is 
therefore necessary to identify these dangers already when the machine 
is designed and reduce them by means of suitable measures.
The EU Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC stipulates that a machine should 
not pose any danger. However, as there is no 100% safety in engineering, 
the aim is to reduce these dangers to a tolerable level of residual risk by 
means of risk reduction measures. The overall safety of a machine defines 
the state in which it can be considered as being free of unwarranted risks 
to persons or as free of danger. The functional safety is part of the overall 
safety of a system which depends on the correct functioning of the safety-
related systems, other technology, safety-related systems and external 
risk reduction facilities.
Reducing the risk of a machine
The international standard EN ISO 12100 “Safety of machinery – Basic 
concepts, general principles for design” provides the design engineer 
with detailed assistance in the identification of hazards and the resulting 
risks to be assessed. It contains design guidelines and methods for safe 
design and risk reduction. The first steps concern risk analysis and risk 
assessment in order to achieve the required level of machine safety.
The EN ISO 12100 stipulates detailed requirements that must be carried 
out in an iterative process and clearly documented. This therefore lays 
down the technical measures for the reduction of hazards.
All protective measures deployed in order to achieve the removal of 
hazards or reduction of risk must be implemented according to a fixed 
order as specified by EN ISO 12100:Introduction

IntroductionRisk reduction through the use of safety-related parts of control systems 
The parts of machine control systems that handle safety tasks are defined 
in international standards as the “safety-related parts of control systems” 
(SRP/CS). These parts can consist of hardware or software and can be 
separate or integrated elements of the machine control system. Safety-
related control system parts comprise the entire safety function consisting 
of the input level (sensor), the logic (safety signal processing) and the 
output level (actuator).
The general objective is to design these control system parts so that the 
safety of the control function and the behavior of the control system in 
the event of a fault match the level of risk reduction determined in the risk 
assessment.Risk reduction through the use of safety-related parts of control

12/22 PU05907001Z-ENIntroductionIterative process for the design of safety-related parts of control 
systems
If the final result of stage 1 “Avoid dangers” does not lead to sufficient 
risk reduction in accordance with EN ISO 12100, the iterative process for 
designing the SRP/CS in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1 or EN IEC 62061 
should be used in stage 2 “Secure dangers”.
In accordance with both standards, the required safety functions to be 
executed by the SRP/CS are first identified in order to then determine 
the required properties for each safety function. The appropriate safety 
functions are used according to the application and required safeguard.
Examples of safety functions:
Stopping in case of emergency
Guard door monitoring without interlock/guard 
locking
Guard door monitoring with interlock/guard 
locking
Light curtain
The following chapters present a number of example circuits with 
different safety functions. These have been considered in accordance with 
both international standards EN ISO 13849-1 and EN IEC 62061, and the 
achievable level of safety integrity (PL or SIL) has been calculated with the 
relevant characteristic values.EN ISO 13849-1 /-2 “Safety of machinery – Safety-related parts of 
control systems”
Part 1: General principles for design
Part 2: Validation
EN 954-1, which had already become established as the internationally 
applicable standard in machine safety, is superceded by EN ISO 13849-1, 
which was officially passed at the end of 2006 and which is listed as a 
harmonized standard in the EU Official Journal.
EN ISO 13849-1 implements a quantitative consideration of the safety 
functions beyond the qualitative approach of EN 954-1. Performance levels 
(PL) are defined in EN ISO 13849-1 in order to classify the different levels 
of safety-related performance. The five PLs (a, b, c, d, e) stand for average 
probability values of a dangerous failure per hour.
The final validation of all protective measures, ensuring the reliable 
operation of the desired safety functions is part of EN ISO 13849-2.
EN IEC 62061 “Safety of machinery – functional safety of safety-
related electrical and electronic and programmable electronic 
control systems”
Within the general scope of EN ISO 12100, the EN IEC 62061 standard 
is an alternative standard to EN ISO 13849-1. The safety-related 
performance is described by the three SIL Safety Integrity Levels (1, 2, 3).

Emergency-stop devices must ensure positive opening operation.
In emergency-stop actuators with positive opening contacts → as per  
IEC/EN 60 947-5-1, Appendix K, the contacts are opened by means of a 
rigid link between the actuator and the contact set. Furthermore, these 
devices also need to be tamper-proof.
Emergency-stop contact monitoring with SMC (self-monitoring 
contact) in the event of special hazards that may affect the 
functioning of the actuator:
The SMC system consists of an N/C contact element connected in series 
with an N/O contact element. The dual-channel solution consists of two 
N/C contact elements. In this case, the series connection also consists 
of an N/C and an N/O contact element. The N/O contact of the SMC 
is connected to the actuator in such a way that it will only close when 
a correct connection between actuator and contact element has been 
established. In the event of an incorrectly plugged in or torn-off contact 
element block, or if the cover of the surface-mounted enclosure is torn off, 
the N/O contact will only open (and thereby trigger the safety function) if 
an SMC is installed.
Safety assessment:
The RMQ dual-channel emergency-stop devices without SMC have a 
B10d value of 2,000,000. This makes it possible to implement safety 
configurations up to SIL3 / PL e.
Example:
If, for example, fewer than 660,000 operations are performed each year, 
which will always be the case with emergency-stop devices, a high 
MTTFd value is achieved. Through appropriate measures in the connected 
decision logic, a high DC value can also be achieved. If the configuration 
also conforms to cat. 4, all the requirements for SIL3 / PLe will be met.
When to use an SMC:
If a particular hazard is identified during the risk analysis or validation 
of an emergency-stop button, additional fault-detection measures 
may be necessary, beyond those required in the framework of PL or 
SIL verification. This includes, for example, a mechanical hazard to the

contact element due to impact or shock, or the possibility that the actuator 
will shear off due to moving parts in the vicinity of the device. In such 
cases, stricter safety requirements apply, which operators must take into 
account. In the event of such special hazards, an SMC is used in order to 
reduce the risk level, as required.\n15

Introduction
Safety contactors 
All versions of the DILMS safety contactor are equipped with a top-
mounted auxiliary contact that is non-detachable. This auxiliary contact 
integrates mirror contacts as well as positive-opening contacts. A built-in 
inspection window situated directly above the switch-position indicator 
clearly indicates the current status of the machine or system
This prevents the manual actuation of the safety contactor.
The DILMS range of safety contactors is available in four different sizes, 
which cover the current range from 7 A to 150 A. The product range also 
includes the DILAS safety relay.
The devices cover the following drive types:
• 110V  50Hz, 120V 60Hz 
• 230V 50Hz, 240V 60Hz
• 24VDC (RDC24)
The safety contactors are CE, UL, CSA and SUVA certified. 
Overview:
• Safe status monitoring (inspection window) – manual actuation  
is not possible
• Emergency-stop function with controlled start (category 4)
• Positive-opening contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1
• Mirror contacts
• RAL 1004 golden yellow
• Top-mounted and non-detachable auxiliary contact (at the front)Safety parameters
The same safety parameters are used to calculate the Performance Level 
and the Safety Integrity Level (SIL), regardless of the application. The 
SISTEMA software of the German Institute for Occupational Safety and 
Health, which contains all the relevant components and parameters, 
makes it easy to determine the applicable safety components and risk 
classifications. In this context, the B10d/B10 values are of particular 
importance for safety contactors.

• For simple drives in which the power disconnecting device (main 
switch) can be the emergency stop in an emergency situation 
(Emergency Stop).
• When the immediate disconnection of the power supply does not 
cause hazardous states (uncontrolled stopping – STOP category 0 to 
EN ISO 13850).→The Emergency-stop function is an additional safety function.  
It is not permissible as a sole means of protection!
Requirements
• Emergency stop main switch with red handle on yellow background.
• Choose emergency-stop switch with defined switch position (O/I).
• Emergency-stop switch must be easily accessible.
• Switch disconnector features in accordance with IEC 60947-3, lockable 
in OFF position.
• Breaking capacity sufficient for the currents of all loads and current of 
the largest motor in the blocked state.
• Main switch only as device for Emergency-stop if the disconnection of 
all loads does not lead to hazardous conditions.
• If necessary protect drives with undervoltage releases in order to 
prevent a hazardous automatic restart when the restart command is 
given.
• Observe additional applicable standards, e.g. IEC 60204-1.Properties
• Design with well-tried components and operating principles  
(EN ISO 13849-1 and EN ISO 13849-2).
• Bridging in the switch causes the loss of the safety function.
Function
The operation of the Emergency-stop switch Q1 disconnects the power 
supply of the entire installation. The undervoltage release at Q3 prevents 
a restart of the dangerous drive.1.11 Stopping in the event of an emergency (Emergency-stop disconnection)

The Emergency-stop actuator S1 must be in the enable position (N/C 
contacts closed) so that the enable signal can be issued via the RESET 
pushbutton S2. Actuating the START pushbutton (S3, S5, S7) for the 
respective drive starts the hazardous movement. The self maintaining 
function and its interruption are implemented with additional mirror 
contacts of the enable contactors Q2 to Q4. The appropriate contactor 
drops out. Restarting is possible by actuating the START actuator. If Emergency-stop actuator S1 is pressed during the hazardous movement, 
Safety removes the enable from the outputs. Contactors Q1 - Q4 drop 
out. A restart is only possible after the Emergency-stop actuator and its 
enable are reset via by actuating the RESET pushbutton S2.

If the input voltage of 230 V AC is applied to A1 and A2, the Power 
LED indicates readiness to activate the enable paths. When the RESET 
pushbutton S2 is actuated, the N/C contacts of the feedback circuit Q1-Q4 
check first of all that the contactors are in their rest position. If this state 
is present, the internal enable relays pick up with a rising edge, which 
is indicated via LEDs K1 and K2. The not safety related signalling path (terminal 41-42) is opened and the enable paths (terminal 13-14, 23-24 
and 33-34) are closed.
The contactors Q2, Q3 and Q4 can be activated via the corresponding 
start command S3, S4, S5. The enable contactor Q1 is used for central 
safe disconnection of the drives.

The Emergency-stop actuator S6 must be in the enable position (N/C 
contacts closed) so that the enable signal can be issued via the RESET 
pushbutton S5. Pressing the START pushbutton S1 starts the hazardous 
movement. The self-latching function and its interruption, triggered by 
the the STOP actuator S2, are implemented by the program. Contactor Q2 
drops out. A restart is possible by pressing the START pushbutton.If the hazardous movement is stopped by pressing the Emergency-stop 
actuator, the enable is removed from the outputs and the contactors 
Q1 - Q3 drop out. A restart is only possible after the Emergency-stop 
actuator is reset and enabled by pressing the RESET pushbutton.

The Emergency-stop actuator S4 must be in the enable position (N/C 
contacts closed) so that the enable signal can be issued via the RESET 
pushbutton S3. Pressing the START pushbutton S1 starts the hazardous 
movement. The self-latching function and its interruption are implemented 
in the program. The two contactors drop out, and a restart is possible by 
pressing the START actuator. If the hazardous movement is stopped by 
pressing the Emergency-stop actuator S4, the enable for outputs QS1 and QS2 is removed and the contactors drop out. A restart is only possible 
after the Emergency-stop actuator is reset and enabled by pressing the 
RESET pushbutton.
The drive can be braked actively by using output QS4. However, this 
option is not included in the safety consideration since the frequency 
inverter does not support the safe braking operation.

If power to the ESR5 is supplied via terminals A1 and A2, the enable path 
can be activated by pressing the RESET button. If –K1 and –K2 in the 
safety relay are energized, power will be applied to the STO input, which 
will in turn release the safe start signal. The functional start command and 
the desired operating direction (if any) are communicated through the REV 
and FWD terminals in the drive circuit. Activating an emergency stop will result in the safety relay’s outputs 
being switched off, which in turn will result in the voltage at the variable 
frequency drive’s STO input being removed. After a max. of 1 ms, the 
outputs in the power section (U, V, W) will be in a state in which no 
more torque is produced in the motor (STO function activated). The time 
it takes for the motor to coast to a stop will depend on the mechanical 
system’s inertia and frictional forces.
If there is a short circuit or the supply voltage drops out, this will also 
result in a safe state, as the 24 V at the STO input will drop out as well. B12334

of the safety relay once the longest possible brake time has elapsed. The 
brake time and safety time margin need to be selected accordingly. This 
will implement stop category 1. This makes it possible to brake the drive 
and to quickly bring it to a full stop. From a safety point of view,
the coasting time (the time until the machine has come to a complete, 
safe stop) must be considered without the brake time. The safety 
calculation must be carried out via the STO function only, without taking If power to the ESR5 is supplied via terminals A1 and A2, the enable path 
can be activated by pressing the RESET button and enabling the DA1 via 
terminals 14-16. If –K1 and –K2 in the safety relay are energized, power 
will be applied to the STO input, which will in turn release the safe start 
signal. Actuating the emergency-stop button will switch off
the safety relay outputs, thereby disconnecting the power supply at the 
drive’s STO input. The power supply at theSTO input of the drive will be 
switched off after the selected delay time of the safety relay has elapsed.
A short circuit or failure of the power supply will also result in a safe 
state, as this will also cause the 24 V supply at the STO input to drop out.

Function
If power to the ESR5 is supplied via terminals A1 and A2, the enable path 
can be activated by pressing the RESET button. If –K1 and –K2 in the 
safety relay are energized, power will be applied to the STO input, which 
will in turn release the safe start signal. The functional start command 
and the desired operating direction (if any) are communicated through the 
REV and FWD terminals in the drive circuit.Actuating the emergency-stop button will switch off the safety relay 
outputs, which will disconnect the power supply at the drive’s STO input 
and cause the contactor at the drive output to drop out. Within 1 ms, the 
outputs in the power section (U, V, W) will have entered a state in which 
the motor no longer generates any torque (the STO function has been 
activated). The time that it takes for the motor to coast to a stop will 
depend on the inertia and frictional forces of the mechanical system.
A short circuit or failure of the power supply will also result in a safe 
state, as this will also cause the 24 V supply at the STO input to drop out.

If the input voltage of 24 V AC is applied to A1 and A2, the Power LED 
indicates readiness to activate the enable paths. When the RESET 
pushbutton S1 is actuated, the N/C contacts of the feedback circuit 
Q1 and Q11-Q14 check first of all that the contactors are in their rest 
position. If this state is present, the internal enable relays pick up with a 
rising edge, which is indicated via LEDs K1 and K2.
The not safety related signalling path (terminal 41-42) is opened and 
the enable paths (terminal 13-14, 23-24 and 33-34) are closed. The start 
commands of a higher-level control system can then be applied via motor 
contactors Q11 to Q14. If the emergency-stop actuator is pressed, the 
higher-level contactor Q1 and the AUX power supply of the SmartWire-
DT modules is disconnected. The individual motor contactors Q11-Q14 
thus disconnect their respective drive in addition to contactor Q1.B12334

In the event of a hazard the upstream Safety switches off the 
contactor Q1 via the enable contact QR1. The CMD contactor monitoring 
relay compares the control voltage of the contactor with the status of 
the main contacts. The status of the main contacts of the contactor is 
monitored via an auxiliary N/C contact that acts as a mirror contact in 
accordance with IEC/EN 60947-4-1 Annex F. If the contactor is welded, 
the status of the main contacts does not correspond to the status of the 
control voltage. The undervoltage release of the backup circuit-breaker Q1 is disconnected via an internal relay in the CMD. This disconnects the 
outgoer. The undervoltage release prevents the welded contactor from be 
switched on again. If the contacts of the circuit-breakers are welded, this 
cannot be determined until the main and auxiliary contacts have been 
disconnected and scanned. In this case the load can still be disconnected 
via Q2.B12334

In applications in which a safety shutdown is a normal operating state, 
the supply voltage is not switched  - instead, the actuating circuit is 
switched. In this particular case, a dual-channel application has been 
implemented. Accordingly, the input wiring for controlling clockwise and 
counterclockwise operation, as well as the corresponding ground cable, is 
routed through the safety relay as well.

After the supply voltage is applied to the safety relay (terminal A1-A2), 
the Power LED indicates readiness for activation of the enable paths. 
When the Reset pushbutton S1 is actuated, the N/C contacts of the 
feedback loop Q1 - Q3 check first of all that the contactors are in their 
rest position. If this state is present, the internal enable relays pick up 
with a rising edge, which is indicated via LEDs K1 and K2. The not safety-
related signal path (terminal 51-52) is opened and the enable paths 
(terminal 13-14, 23-24, 33-34 and 43-44) are closed. The contactors Q2 and Q3 can now be activated via the corresponding start command S2 
and S4. The enable contactor Q1 is used for the safety disconnection of 
both drives.B1234

SIL 123Cat
\n48
12/22 PU05907001Z-EN2.2
Function
The guard door must be in a closed position (N/C contact B1 closed) for 
the enable signal to be issued. The feedback loop of the N/C contacts can 
ensure the normal position of the disconnection contactors Q1 - Q3. If the 
status is present, the enable can be issued by actuating the RESET button 
S1. The output QS1 of Safety switches through, contactor Q1 picks 
up and its fed back signalling contact opens. Pressing the START actuator 
S2, S4 for the respective drive starts the hazardous movement.
The self-latching function and its interruption are implemented by the 
 Safety program. The appropriate contactor drops out. Restarting is 
possible by actuating the START actuator. Opening the guard causes the 
 Safety outputs QS1 - QS3 to disconnect and thus de-energize the 
enable paths. The  Safety is switched to operational readiness by the 
reclosed N/C contacts.Application
• For occasional interventions in the hazardous area and possible 
prevention of the hazard under certain conditions or when the hazard 
potential is low.• If the stopping time is less than the entry and access time.

12/22 PU05907001Z-EN• Single-channel connection fault is not reliably detected if the second 
door is opened.
• A single fault does not cause the loss of safety function.
• An accumulation of undetected faults can cause a hazardous situation 
(connection fault with two contacts).
• Monitoring of redundant contactors/safety valves via feedback loop.
• Planned movement of the movable guard is normally detected by an 
N/C / N/O contact combination.
Function
After the supply voltage is applied to the safety relay (terminal A1-A2), the 
Power LED indicates readiness for activation of the enable paths. When 
the last still opened guard is closed, the N/C contacts of the feedback loop 
check first of all that the contactors Q1 and Q2 are in their rest position. 
If this state is present, the enable relays inside the ESR pick up, which is 
indicated via LEDs K1 and K2.
The not safety-related signalling path (terminal 41-42) is opened and 
contactors Q1 and Q2 can pick up via the enable paths (terminal 13-14 and 
23-24).Application
• For cyclical interventions in the hazardous area.
• When only a protective door is actuated during interventions in the 
hazardous area.• If the stopping time is less than the entry and access time.

When the last still opened guard is closed, the Safety Gate (SG) safety 
function block issues the enable to activate the device safety outputs. The 
feedback circuit monitoring then first checks that the contactors are in the 
rest position. If this state is present, the EM (External Monitor) function 
block issues the enable and sets device outputs QS1 and QS2. The 
contactors Q1 and Q2 pick up and their normally closed contacts open.→The device switches off safely if there is a connection fault 
across the contacts of a channel. A restart is prevented by the 
diagnostics device of the positively driven auxiliary contacts.

After the supply voltage is applied to the safety relay (terminal A1-A2), the 
Power LED indicates readiness for activation of the enable paths. When 
the guard is closed, the N/C contacts of the feedback circuit check first of 
all that the contactors Q1 and Q2 are in their rest position. If this state is 
present, the enable relays inside the ESR pick up, which is indicated via 
LEDs K1 and K2. The not safety-related signalling path (terminal 31-32) 
is opened and contactors Q1 and Q2 can pick up via the enable paths 
(terminal 13-14 and 23-24).Opening the guard switches off relays K1 and K2 inside the ESR via the 
two position switches B1, B2. The not safety-related signal path (terminal 
31-32) closes and the enable paths open. The contactors Q1, Q2 drop out 
and the safety relay switches to ready status via the now closed N/C

After the supply voltage is applied to the safety relay K1 (terminal A1-A2), 
the Power LED indicates operational readiness for activating the enable

The muting function makes it possible to automatically bridge the safety 
function of the EPSE B1 for a specific time. This enables goods to be 
transported through the monitored area of the guard B1 without stopping 
the cyclical operation. Two groups of muting sensors arranged next to 
each other detect the beginning and the end of the movement through 
the protected area and start the monitoring of the maximum permissible 
muting time.

After the supply voltage is applied to the safety relay K1 (terminal A1-
A2) the Power LED indicates operational readiness for activating the 
enable paths. Actuating the two-hand control S1 (both actuators pressed 
simultaneously within max. 0.5 seconds) causes first a check to be made 
on the rest position of contactors Q1 and Q2 via the N/C contacts of the 
feedback circuit. If this state is present, LEDs K1 and K2 indicate the concurrent operation of the two-hand control. The not safety-related 
signal path of the safety relay is opened and the contactors are then 
actuated via the two closing enable paths.

Actuating the two-hand control S1 (both actuators pressed simultaneously 
within max. 0.5 seconds) causes the “Two-hand control Type III” (TH, two-
hand button) safety function block to monitor the concurrent actuation of 
the two-hand control. Safety then checks the rest position of the two contactors Q1 and Q2 
via the N/C contacts of the feedback circuit. If this state is also present, 
Safety issues the enable signal via outputs QS1 and QS2. Both 
contactors pick up and switch on the hazardous drive.

Requirements
• Speed measuring with redundant safety speed sensors.
• Install redundant contactors and with mechanically linked and feedback 
contacts.
• Hard wire with electromechanical components.
• Document exchange interval for contactors (case B).
• Take into account the load on the contactors, i.e. also that of the 
Emergency-stop function, 6.1 “Stopping in an emergency (Emergency-
stop disconnection)”, page 78.
• Case A: Unrestricted utilization period.
• Case B: Exchange contactors after 4.5 years.
• Acknowledgement required after guard is closed.
• Observe additional applicable standards, e.g. IEC 60204-1.Properties
• Design with basic and well-tried safety principles (EN ISO 13849-1 and 
EN ISO 13849-2)
• Proximity sensors, supply conductor and command processing are 
redundant and self-monitoring.
• Single faults: Wire break and connection are detected reliably by 
means of the measuring principle. Observe mounting instructions of 
manufacturer!6.3 Combining several safety functions\n83
12/22 PU05907001Z-ENFunction
When the limit speed configured in the Safety is reached, the 
overspeed monitoring function block (OM, Overspeed monitor) removes 
the enable of the safety outputs QS1 and QS2 and thus de-energizes 
the contactors Q2 and Q3. The N/C contacts in the feedback circuit can 
be used to determine whether the contactors have returned to their rest position before a renewed enable signal is issued by actuating the RESET 
button S4.

Requirements
• Ensure that the AST parameter setting of a safety function block never 
causes the unexpected startup of the machine or an uncontrolled 
change in the speed of the machine.
• Contactors must have an operating voltage tolerance of between 85 % 
to 110 % of the control voltage in accordance with IEC 60947-1.
• Hard wire with electromechanical components.
Properties
• Control voltage dips up to -15 % do not lead to disconnection.
• Mode parameter allows the startup behaviour of each safety function 
block to be set: AST – automatic start, MST – manual start, CST – 
controlled start.Function
The Mode parameter enables you to set the startup behaviour of the 
safety function block. The restart prevents uncontrolled starting after the 
power supply is switched on and after the protected area is enabled. If a 
manual restart is still required, the self maintaining function in the circuit 
diagram can be programmed (see programming window).7.2 Preventing restarts\n87

Figure 51:  Use of a fuse as a protective deviceThe reliability of the protective function does not only depend on the 
equipment and circuitry selected. Other factors and interrelationships 
should also be taken into account.
Weld-free design
Open the circuit, “switch off” the hazard – this is not possible with welded 
contacts.
If the switching device is for safety purposes, a risk evaluation may make 
overdimensioning or redundancy necessary (“Feedback Circuit”, page 106).
Try to ensure that the protective device trips in the event of a short-circuit 
or overcurrent before the contacts of the switching devices weld. The 
protective device should naturally also be able to withstand the motor 
startup or the switching on of transfomers.Design the control circuit correctly
A short-circuit in the control circuit can cause uncontrolled states. In the 
worst case this may cause the failure of the safety functions. This may 
either cause
• contacts to weld or
• the short-circuit current to cause the tripping of the short-circuit 
protective device.
In both cases, the correct choice of short-circuit protective device and the 
transformer is critical.
Section 7.2.10 in IEC 60204-1 stipulates that protective devices should be 
weld-free: “When selecting those protective devices, consideration shall 
be given to the protection of switching devices against damage due to 
overcurrents (for example welding of the switching device contacts).
You should therefore choose the lowest value for the maximum 
permissible overcurrent protective device specified for the switching 
devices used.
Ensure that the prospective short-circuit current in your control circuits 
does not exceed 1000 A. Switching devices in accordance with EN 60947-
5-1 are protected against welding up to this maximum value by means of 
the protective devices specified.
The limitation of the prospective short-circuit current can be achieved 
through the use of:
• Transformers
• Protective device and cable length/cross section11.1 Engineering machines\n103

The protective device should respond quickly in the event of a short-
circuit.
When selecting the protective device, you must ensure that in the event of 
a short-circuit, the breaking current is reached within 0.2 s.
• Determine therefore the short-circuit current value, taking the following 
factors into account:
 –Transformer.
 –Cable length.
 –Conductor cross-section.
• Then select a short-circuit protective device with a maximum response 
value lower than the short-circuit current value. Use the following

The capacitance of long control conductors in AC circuits may impede 
contactors from dropping out in response to an Emergency-stop command. 
This is particularly the case of:
• High control voltage (e.g. 500 V).
• Low contactor sealing current.
• Contactors with very low drop-out voltages Ua  
(IEC 60947-4-1: 10 % < Ua < 75 %)
The control conductor must therefore not exceed a maximum length lmax 
for a given control voltage and contactor size, otherwise the capacitance 
of the control conductors will prevent the contactor from switching off due 
to the sealing current present.
Maximum cable length lmax
The actual conductor capacitance C must be less than Cmax in order to 
ensure trouble-free switching of a contactor. With continuous contacts 
the capacitance C must be expected and with pulse contacts 2 x C. In the 
latter case, the maximum length of the control conductor Imax is therefore 
only half the length as for continuous contact.

12/22 PU05907001Z-ENRemedy if the contactor does not drop out
If during the engineering phase or during commissioning it is determined 
that the contactors do not drop out due to the long control conductor 
lengths involved, use the following methods to solve the problem:
• Use a larger contactor (higher sealing power)
• Reduce the control voltage (allow for voltage drop).
• Use a DC actuated contactor.
• The coil is shorted by means of an additional N/C contact for two-wire 
control and N/O contact for three-wire control. An additional cable 
is required for this. The disconnection times of the contactors will 
increase considerably.

Feedback Circuit
Insert an N/C contact for each of the subsequent contactors at the 
location of the “feedback circuit” for additional enable paths or for 
monitoring redundant contactors. The N/C contacts must be suitable as 
mirror contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-4-1, Annex F. If one of these 
contactors welds, the circuit stays in the rest state with the next ON 
command until the fault is rectified. See circuits on page 24, 58 and 80.

Main circuit
Figure 58:  Feedback circuit, monitor external contactorsProvide redundancy
Redundancy means that more components than required for normal 
operation are provided. A typical form of redundancy is the double 
provision of contactor relays in the Emergency-stop combination, such as 
→ chapter 1.7 “With electronically controlled drives”, page 28
If one of the devices fails because it is not energized or is blocked, the 
other device establishes the safe condition and the fault is detected. This, 
however, can only be carried out with positively driven auxiliary contacts.
Ensure diversity
This involves the design of control circuits using different function 
principles or with different types of components, such as the combination 
of N/C and N/O contacts that are actuated by the protective devices 
→ chapter 2.5 “Dual-channel with safety relay”, page 54.
Carry out function tests
The control system should carry out the function tests automatically in the 
best case. Many functions cannot be tested automatically. For example, 
an Emergency-stop actuator is only actuated in the event of an emergency. 
Carry out individual function tests at appropriate intervals.
Arrange devices effectively
Refer to the requirements of “ISO 14119”, page 118 concerning the 
arrangement of position switches.
Use safety switching devices and programmable electronic safety 
control relays
Safety switching devices are components of the protective equipment 
on machines and plants. Their use reduces the risk for the protection of 
persons, material and machines.
The decision whether to use a conventional or an electronically 
programmable safety device depends on the application at hand. A 
conventional safety switching device is an effective solution for simple 
applications. Contact expansion modules enable safety-related enabling 
paths to be reproduced cost effectively ( → figure 59, page 107).
With complex tasks, an electronically programmable control relay can 
offer an extensive range of functions. The flexible programming allows you 
to implement different safety-related functions and safety categories.
The entire machine or system control is normally implemented separately 
in a non-safety section with conventional PLC technology and a safety-
related section with safety switching devices or control relays.11.3 Engineering machines\n107
12/22 PU05907001Z-EN• Consideration of the environmental conditions with the placement of 
control panels, operating elements and indication elements.
• Extended functions with the setting mode:
 –Jog operation for the operation of drives.
 –With additional selection of the direction of rotation.
 –Startup function with incorrect start position.
• Marker function for continued unhindered operation after stop.
• Display of the stored actual situation.
• Faults should be detectable from a safe location: Extended indication 
functions.
• From a safe location, it must be possible to simultaneously observe the 
critical machine movements and the indicating instruments while being 
able to operate the control elements.
• After reset of an action in an emergency (emergency-stop command), 
the machine must not restart automatically. The Start command must 
occur via a separate pushbutton.Prevent foreseeable misuse
Machines are reset for operation as soon possible after malfunctions.
Example: Packages, pallets or machine parts jam inside a palletizing 
machine. After an Emergency-stop the machine should restart. The 
operator therefore goes to the danger zone and tries to rectify the fault. 
For this situation, the drive may possibly have to start in the opposite 
direction.
If this is only possible by manually operating the contactors, there is a 
high risk of danger. The wrong drive may be started or the wrong rotation 
direction may be selected.
The implementation of the features required by the standards is not 
enough. More foresighted planning in cooperation between machine 
designers and electrical engineers is required.

12/22 PU05907001Z-EN12 The way to a safe machine
12.1 Schedule
The way to a safe machine
Your machine must be demonstrably safe, i.e. it must perform its functions 
without causing injury or damage to health. As a rule you are permitted 
to provide self-certification and to refer to the “responsible authorities” 
in special cases. This should also be certified externally by affixing the CE 
mark.
Hazard detected, hazard excluded
A risk estimation must be made for the entire machine as well as for its 
associated parts. If the conclusion is reached that a circuit or component 
failure in protective devices may cause danger, then additional measures 
must be taken to avoid the risks in the event of a fault. This procedure 
must be executed carefully and documented in every case.
Create a factory standard
• Identify the relevant directives.
• Research the standards.
→ chapter “The European safety concept”, page 110
Prepare technical documentation
• List the basic requirements.
• Carry out a hazard and risk analysis.
• Describe solutions.
• Specify test criteria.
If a relevant type C standard does not exist, the machine engineer must 
evaluate the risk by means of a hazard analysis, implement measures to 
minimize risks, carry out tests and record results.
The type B standards EN ISO 12100, EN ISO 13849-1 and EN IEC 62061 
will help the engineer in the assessment and reduction of risks.Integrate a safety concept
• Inherently safe design.
• Technical safety measures and additional protective measures.
• User information concerning residual risk
 –on the machine
 –in the user manual
The protective measures to be taken must have the objective of excluding 
the risk of accidents during the machine lifetime, from manufacture to 
decommissioning, dismantling and disposal, in all operating situations.
Prepare operating instructions
• Basic safety chapter
• Special danger warnings
• Translate operating instructions
The operating instructions with the description of “intended use” and 
“warnings” are important for the user. The completed risk evaluation is of 
use here: “Warning of residual hazards that cannot be excluded”.
Create a declaration of conformity
The manufacturer must prepare a declaration of conformity for each 
machine in which the relevant EN standards are mentioned and the 
conformity of the machine is declared. If compliance with these standards 
is ensured, it can be assumed that the requirements of the Machinery 
Directive are also fulfilled.
If a machine is listed in Annex IV and V of the Machinery Directive, special 
conformity assessment procedures must be applied in accordance with 
clause 12. A list of the machines in accordance with Annex IV and V is 
shown on page 156.
Annex II of the Machinery Directive stipulates two different declarations 
of conformity:
1. Annex II A for machines.  
2. Annex II B for incomplete machines.
In addition to the declaration of conformity, the manufacturer must 
document all relevant hazards/risks and counter measures with test 
results. This documentation is not written for customers but must be 
presented to a “responsible authority” if this is “requested on justifiable 
grounds”.12.1 The way to a safe machine
In the future EU machinery regulation you will find special conformity 
assessment procedures for high risk machinery.
You can already find more detailed information in our white paper
“New version of the Machinery Directive as well as EN ISO 13849-1 
and EN IEC 62061”.
Free download: Eaton.com/safety\n109
12/22 PU05907001Z-ENAffix CE mark
The manufacturer and the authorized agent in the EU (licensee/
contract partner) must declare the conformity of products with the 
safety requirements of the relevant directives and EN standards. This is 
documented by the issuing of an EU declaration of conformity.
The manufacturer takes full responsibility for the affixing of the CE 
marking after prototype testing. The CE mark is a compulsory condition 
of sale since from the date of compulsory CE marking onwards, products/
components/devices/systems may not be sold without the CE mark.
The CE marking should be considered like a passport within the European 
single market. It must not, however, be confused with a quality mark or 
seal since it is only intended as an administrative marking. The CE marking 
mainly is designed for the competent body. It indicates to purchasers 
and end users that it can be “assumed” that the product meets the 
requirements of the directive or the applicable legislation.The CE marking must be carried out before putting the product onto the 
market, i.e. before selling and commissioning. Putting into circulation 
as defined by the directive applies to any transfer of technical devices, 
products or other goods to others. Importation into the EU is also 
considered as putting into circulation, and so imported goods must also 
be provided with the CE marking if they are required to comply with a 
directive. Technical equipment includes working equipment that is ready 
for use, devices, tools and machines. Technical equipment includes 
working equipment that is ready for use, devices, tools and machines. 
Working equipment is ready for use when it can be used for the intended 
purpose. No other parts are required.
Putting into circulation, and thus CE marking, applies to the following 
machines:
• New machines produced for the first time in the EU.
• Existing machines which must be retrofitted and/or modified.
• All machines (new ones and existing machines) which are imported 
from a non-EU country and which are sold and/or used in the EU.
• New or modified machines which are provided free of charge.

Figure 60:  EC/EU Directives concerning the CE markingThe European safety concept
There are several different directives with compulsory marking 
requirements and a large and rapidly growing number of EN standards 
(harmonized European standards). Their aim and purpose is to assist the 
free movement of goods within the European Union on the basis that each 
member state will have similar requirements for ensuring that minimum 
safety levels for users are met.
EU directives = national legislation
EU directives are a type of blanket directive. The directives must be 
implemented by all member states into national legislation.
The EU directives are primarily there to ensure a standard and binding 
legal framework.
However, only the basic requirements are specified without technical 
details so as not to impair technological developments.
The European standards
The European standards (EN standards) are implemented into the national 
standards of each member state within the European Union.National standards with contents not complying with EN standards are 
withdrawn.
This applies to DIN/VDE standards as well as to work safety standards 
VBG..., ZH... etc. (in Germany) By complying with the EN standards, it can 
be “assumed” that the requirements of the directives are fulfilled. These 
EN standards are listed in the “Report of the commission in the scope of 
the execution of the guideline”.
Can EN draft standards be used?
Only the valid (white paper) EN standards are to be used.
As long as there are no EN standards for a particular field, or only drafts, 
then the national standards can and should be used.
In practice, the draft standards (prEN..) published in the EC Official Journal 
are also used by the responsible authority as the basis for conformity 
assessment.12.2 The way to a safe machine\n111
12/22 PU05907001Z-ENThe EN “Safety for Machines” standards are divided into three main 
groups:
• Type A: Basic standards
defines requirements which apply to all machine types and are basic 
safety requirements.
• Type B: Group standards
deal with design aspects such as distances, surface temperatures, ... or 
functional aspects such as Emergency-stop, two-hand control, ... These 
aspects apply to different machine groups.
• Type C: Product standards
are “product standards” that stipulate specific requirements placed on 
individual machine types. The type C standard enables the safety of the 
machines to be tested and certified.

Safety of machinery – Electrical equipment of machines –  
Part 1: General requirements
Type C Machine safety standards with detailed safety requirements 
for specific machines or a group of machines.
→The product standard must first be observed for the relevant 
machine type. This normally refers to the relevant group 
standards. If the C standard contains requirements that are 
different, the C standard applies.
The safety requirements stipulated in the Machinery Directive and in EN 
standards depend on the risk of accident involved. Most type C standards 
take into account the specific risks of the machine type concerned. The 
degree of safety required therefore tends to depend on the particular 
standard concerned.
Old machines
Information on machines put into circulation on the market and 
commissioned before 12-29-2009 is provided in section 13.4 
“Requirements for existing machines”, page 159.Low-voltage Directive
The Low-Voltage Directive 2006/95/EC requires the mandatory CE marking 
of electrical equipment. The fulfillment of safety objectives is meant to 
ensure protection from hazards caused by electrical current in low-voltage 
devices. Important basic requirements in the form of safety objectives are 
described in Annex I of the directive.
Low-voltage devices include electrical switching devices, conductors, 
cables, wires and installation components with a voltage range of 50 – 
1000 V AC and 120 – 1500 V DC (see EN 50110-1).
EMC Directive
The marking of products compliant with the EMC Directive 2004/108/EEC 
has been compulsory since 1996. The EMC Directive stipulates two basic 
requirements placed on the electromagnetic compatibility of devices:
• IEC 61000-6-1 – Immunity, i.e. the appropriate immunity of devices to 
electromagnetic interference.
• IEC 61000-6-3 – Emission, i.e. the highest value of electromagnetic 
interference emitted by devices (radiation, emission).
Different requirements are placed on industrial applications on the one 
hand, and home, business, trade, light industry, small companies, offices 
and laboratories on the other.
Machinery Directive
Since the beginning of 1995 CE marking has been made obligatory for 
compliance with the Machinery Directive 89/392/EC. The new Machinery 
Directive 2006/42/EC has been in force from 29.12.2009 and thus replaces 
the previously valid 98/37 EC. It stipulates the general requirements 
placed on the safety of machines and the health the user/operator.
What is a “machine”?
In accordance with this directive, a machine means an “assembly of linked 
parts or components, at least one of which moves, with the appropriate 
actuators, control and power circuits etc., joined together for a specific 
application.”
It also includes the actuating devices as well as the control and power 
circuits which are added for a particular application (such as the 
processing, treatment, moving or packaging of a material).
However, the Machinery Directive only contains basic requirements 
whilst there are many different types of machines available. The question 
therefore arises: “How can I prove that my machine is safe?”
The EN standards consequently stipulate requirements that can be tested 
and are therefore certifiable for this purpose.

Purpose
By which basic and pragmatic methods can machines of all types be 
designed in compliance with European legislation?
If no product standard exists for your machine, important guidance is 
provided here. This Type A standard forms the basis for Type B and C 
standards.
Target group
Machine designers B and C standards makers and creators of factory 
standards.
Essential points in brief
The strategy for risk reduction is specified as follows:
Perform a risk assessment by carrying out the following steps in the order 
given:
• Determine limits and intended use of the machine.
• Identify possible hazards and hazardous situations.
• Assess the risk for every hazard or hazardous situation.
• Evaluate risk and make decisions on the necessity of risk reduction.
If the result of the risk assessment shows that risk reduction is necessary, 
protective measures must be taken according to the following “3-step 
method”.
1. Inherently safe design
Choose suitable design features as principal measures for hazard removal:
• No sharp corners or edges.
• Observe minimum clearances from hazards.
• Reduce forces, speeds and weights to safe values.
• Design parts within the load limits.
• Use intrinsically safe technologies such as safety extra-low voltage, 
non-toxic fluids in the hydraulics etc.
• Mechanical restraint devices shall be given preference over solutions 
dependent on power when the transfer of movement is involved.
• Ensure ergonomic features such as sufficient lighting and ergonomic 
operation.
• Exclude hazardous behaviour of the machinery such as unexpected 
startups or uncontrolled speed changes by means of safe control 
system design.
• Fault detection by means of redundant design
• Minimize the work required in the danger zone through:
 –Reliability of machine functions – this reduces the frequency of the 
interventions required. –No manual loading and unloading of the machinery.
 –Setting and maintenance locations outside the danger zone.
Take into account all “phases of the working life” of the machine:  
Construction, transport and commissioning, operation and implementation, 
decommissioning, dismantling and, when necessary, disposal.
2. Risk reduction by means of technical safeguards
Technical protection measures must be applied if it is not possible to 
reduce the potential hazards by means of appropriate design features.
Example 1:
If access to the danger zone is not necessary during operation, close 
this area off by means of mechanical covers. EN 953 describes the 
requirements placed on “ guards”.
Example 2:
Ensure the following measures if the user must work in the danger zone:
• Movable guard with monitoring feature.
• Electro-sensitive protective equipment.
• Two-hand control.
The guards should remain functional when possible during maintenance 
and setting operations. If this is not possible, a lockable operating mode 
selector switch must be used. This should enable an operating mode of 
“reduced risk” such as creep speed to be selected manually.
3. User information concerning residual risk
You were not able to remove all hazards satisfactorily by means of design 
measures or technical safeguards? Warn the user directly by means of 
clear indications in the operating instructions at the location of danger!
Risk estimation and evaluation must be carried out after each of the three 
stages for risk reduction → figure 63, page 115.

Overview of relevant safety standards
Additional precautionary measures
In the event of an emergency one or several Emergency-stop devices must 
be provided. This is not necessary for:
• Portable handheld or manually operated machines.
• Machines where the risk is not reduced by an Emergency-stop.
The Emergency-stop function must not be regarded as a substitute for 
protective measures. It must be designed so that the hazardous movement 
can be stopped by suitable means according to the risk assessment (see 
EN ISO 13850).
Energy isolation and dissipation are required for repair and maintenance 
work. For this use for example lockable main switches with isolating 
function.
Furthermore:
• Provide connection possibilities for transport with lifting gear.
• Ensure that all work such as operation, maintenance etc. can be carried 
out on the floor or on non-slip platforms.
• Ensure static and dynamic stability.

Figure 62:  Risk reduction strategy12.3 The way to a safe machine\n115
12/22 PU05907001Z-ENStep 4: Risk evaluation
A risk evaluation must be carried out after the risk estimation in order to 
assess the necessity of risk reduction. If risk reduction is required, refer 
to the risk reduction points stated in EN ISO 12100. The risk assessment 
must then be repeated.
• Has the necessary level of safety been achieved?
• Have hazards been removed/reduced?
• Do the technical protective measures offer sufficient protection and can 
they be used in practice?
• Is the category selected in accordance with EN ISO 13849 or EN IEC 
62061 correct?
• Are instructions for the intended use clearly formulated and 
understandable?
• Are the safe working procedures described properly?
• Is the user informed of the necessity of the personal protective 
equipment?
• Is the user warned sufficiently of residual risks?
The certification of the hazard analysis is a check that all significant 
hazards have been identified and appropriate precautions have been 
taken, such as the selection of the suitable category in accordance with 
EN ISO 13849 or subsystem architecture in accordance with IEC 62601. 
Protective measures and the objectives achieved through them must be 
documented.Step 1:
Limits of the machineStep 2:
Hazard analysisStep 3:
Risk estimationStep 4:
Risk evaluation
Figure 63:  Risk assessment in 4 steps
Step 1: Limits of a machine
Define first of all the limits of the machine.
• Which functions are to be fulfilled by the machine and which not? 
Proper usage and foreseeable faults and misuse.
• Who should use the machine and who not? Qualification and 
experience of the personnel in all areas from development to 
maintenance.
Step 2: Hazard analysis
Identify the hazards:
• Which kind of hazards are present on the machine? Use the tables in 
EN ISO 12100 as a check list. This table indicates possible electrical, 
mechanical, chemical and physical dangers
• Assess the ambient and operating conditions of the machine.
• Which events can cause damage? Manual material supply or removal, 
service, maintenance, human behaviour, influence by persons that are 
not operating personnel, failure of safety-related components.
Step 3: Risk estimation
Estimate the risk for each hazardous situation by determining the 
following factors:
• Severity of damage (slight, serious, fatal)
• Probability of occurrence of the damage depending on:
 –Exposure to the hazard by one or several persons.
 –Occurrence of a hazardous incident.
 –Possibility to reduce or limit the damage.
Assess the risk for every hazardous situation taking the following factors 
into account:
• Take all affected persons into account.
• Type, frequency and duration of stay in the hazardous area.
• Relationship between exposure to the hazard and effects.
• Human factors: risk awareness, training, time pressure.
• Suitability of the protective measures.
• Possibility of defeating the implemented safety measures.
• Combination and interrelationship of hazardous situations (complexity).

Purpose
• Design and assessment of a safety-related control system.
• Determine and assess the degree of resistance to faults, depending on 
the risk of hazard.
• Check and document the requirements stipulated and achieved.
Target group
• Machine designers
• Design engineers
• Independent test institutes
• “C” standard makers
• Creators of factory standards
Essential points in brief
EN ISO 13849 stipulates safety requirements and provides a guide to the 
principles for designing and integrating safety-related parts of control 
systems (SRP/CS) and software.
Properties are defined for these parts of the SRP/CS that are required for 
the implementation of the corresponding safety functions.
The probability of failure must be estimated for each SRP/CS and/or 
combination of SRP/CS that represents a safety function. This value is 
expressed as the performance level (PL a to e).
The technologies and energies (electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic, 
mechanical etc.) used for a machine are not considered in the design of an 
SRP/CS.
The PL of the SRP/CS is determined by estimating the following 
parameters:
• MTTFd value of each component
• DC
• CCF
• Architecture of the category
• Behaviour of the safety function under fault condition(s)
• Systematic failures
• The ability to perform a safety function under foreseeable 
environmental conditions.12.3 The way to a safe machineThe way to a safe machine

Safety of machinery – functional safety of safety-related electrical, 
electronic and programmable electronic control systems
Purpose
Examination and assessment of the performance level (PL) and the safety 
integrity level (SIL) of a safety-related control system.
Target group
• Machine designers
• Design engineers
• Independent test institutes
• “C” standard makers
• Creators of factory standards
Essential points in brief
This standard specifies the requirements and gives recommendations 
for the design, integration and validation of safety-related electrical, 
electronic and programmable electronic control system (SRECS) of 
machines.
It is restricted to risks that arise directly from the hazards of the machine 
itself or a group of machines in coordinated operation.
It does not specify requirements for the performance of non-electrical (e.g. 
hydraulic, pneumatic) control elements for machines.
The safety integrity requirements of the safety-related control function 
must be derived from the risk assessment. This can ensure that the 
necessary level of risk reduction is achieved. This standard expresses the 
safety integrity as a failure limit value for the probability of a dangerous 
failure per hour for each safety function. This value is divided into three 
safety integrity levels (SIL).

12/22 PU05907001Z-ENInterlocking devices with and without guard locking
An interlocking device without guard locking is a mechanical or 
electrical device that only allows the operation of a machine if the 
guard door is closed (e.g. safety position switch with separate actuating 
element).
LS-ZB (Type 2) RS-Titan (Type 3)
Figure 66:  LS-ZB safety position switch with separate actuating element
This protective measure prevents the hazardous machine functions if the 
guard is not closed. Opening the guard during operation triggers a Stop 
command. It has the same meaning as a Stop command (EN ISO 13 850, 
Emergency-stop devices). Closing the guard switches the machine to 
operational readiness. The Start signal must be made separately.
STOPP • Door open
• Voltage off
• No hazard
Figure 67: Interlock equipment without guard locking for personnel

An interlocking device with guard locking is a mechanical or electrical 
device that only allows the operation of a machine if the guard door is 
closed and locked (e.g. safety position switch with separate actuating 
element and guard locking).

ISO 14119
Safety of machinery – Interlocking devices associated with guards –
Principles for design and selection
Purpose
How should movable guards be monitored?
The standard describes the principles for the selection and design of 
interlock devices and their connection to the guard door  
(→ EN 953) or to the control system ( → EN ISO 13849, EN IEC 62061).
Target group
Machine designers and Type C standard makers.
Essential points in brief
This standard describes the basic terms and general design principles for 
interlock devices and guards.
Select and design the type of interlock device for your application so that 
the basic EU safety requirements are fulfilled.
Important selection criteria for a suitable interlock device in special 
applications are:
• The application conditions and the intended use.
• The hazards present at the machine.
• The severity of the possible injury.
• The probability of a failure of the interlock device.
• The stopping time and entry or access time.
• The duration by which a person is exposed to the hazard.
Some of these criteria have already been covered in EN ISO 12100, 
EN ISO 13849 and EN IEC 62061.
Designs are still grouped as with and without guard locking.
ISO 14119 distinguishes between four different types of interlocking 
devices:
• Type 1: Mechanical actuation principle, contact, force / uncoded  
 actuator, e.g., rotary cams, linear cams
• Type 2: Mechanical actuation principle, contact, force / coded actuator,  
 e.g., tongue (shaped actuator)
• Type 3: Non-contact actuation principle, e.g., magnetic / uncoded  
 actuator, e.g., magnet
• Type 4: Non-contact actuation principle, e.g., RFID / coded actuator,  
 e.g., coded RFID tag
Type 3 and type 4 interlocking devices usually feature a high degree of 
protection (e.g., IP67, IP69K), are affected less by soiling, and are more 
tolerant to guard misalignments.
If a type 3 or type 4 interlocking device is the only interlocking device, it 
must meet the requirements in IEC 60947-5-3. 
Designs are still grouped as with and without guard locking.12.3 The way to a safe machineThe way to a safe machine
Overview of relevant safety standards\n119
12/22 PU05907001Z-ENThe hazardous machine functions are made safe by means of a closed 
and locked guard. The guard stays closed until the risk of injury by the 
hazardous machine function is excluded (e.g. by means of speed or zero 
speed monitors).
The machine is made operational by closing and locking the guard. The 
Start signal must also be issued here separately.

Which type should be used when?
Stopping time > entry or access time

Stopping time > entry or access time
→ Interlock device without guard locking
Example:
An operator opens the guard door of a lathe and thus switches off the 
drive energy. He then reaches into the hazardous area to retrieve a 
workpiece.
The hazardous movement must be finished before the operator reaches 
these parts of the machine. Otherwise an interlock device with guard 
locking must be used.
The stopping time of the machine can be determined very easily.
The entry or access time is determined by the parameters “Clearance”, 
“Approach speed” and machine-specific factors such as “Type of 
accessibility”.
You can calculate this time using DIN EN 999/ISO 13855 “The positioning 
of protective equipment in respect of approach speeds of parts of the 
human body”.Type of actuation of mechanical position switches

• Protect against self-loosening.
• Use oblong holes only for initial setting.
• Ensure mechanical restraint by means of bolts, pins, mechanical stops 
etc.
• Switch must not be used as a mechanical stop.
• Observe the paths specified by the switch manufacturer (figure 63, 
page 115).
• Ensure that the switch is protected so that external influences cannot 
cause any damage.
• Fit the switch so that it is accessible for maintenance and function 
testing.
• When the guard door is opened, ensure that intervention in the 
hazardous area is not made until the hazardous movement has stopped.

Safety of machinery
Emergency-stop equipment – Principles for design
Purpose
Function requirements of devices for stopping in an emergency 
(Emergency-stop equipment).
Target group
Machine designers and Type C standard makers.
Essential points in brief
The Emergency-stop function should prevent or reduce arising or existing 
hazards to personnel and damage to machines or to the working material. 
Hazards may, for example, be functional irregularities, malfunctions of the 
machine, unacceptable properties in the processed material and human 
errors.
Emergency-stop is required
This standard stipulates the mandatory use of Emergency-stop devices for 
each machine with the following exceptions:
• Machines on which Emergency-stop devices do not reduce the risk.
• Hand-held and manually operated machines.
Emergency-stop is a supporting measure and not a substitute for missing 
protection measures!
Emergency-stop devices must be provided on all operating panels and 
other working stations in accordance with IEC 60204-1.
Emergency-stop operation
The Emergency-stop function is activated by a single manual operation of 
a person. It must always be available and functional ( ➔ EN ISO 13849-1). 
The particular operating mode is not important.
Design the Emergency-stop devices in such a way that the user is not 
forced to consider the consequences of operating the device. This 
prevents delays up to the point of activating the device when the system 
is disconnected.
The efficiency of safety devices and devices with safety-related functions 
must not be impaired by the Emergency-stop function. This also includes 
the rescue of persons from hazardous situations.

The reaction of the machine to the Emergency-stop command must not

Check what the minor risk represents:
• Immediate disconnection = STOP category 0.
• Controlled stopping = STOP category 1.
STOP category 0
The system is disconnected by immediate disconnection of the supply 
to the drive element or by mechanical interruption (disconnection) of 
hazardous elements and their drive elements.
Application example: main switch with Emergency-stop function or 
Emergency-stop switching device in conjunction with undervoltage 
release.
STOP category 1
A controlled stop with power to the drive element available to achieve the 
stop. Once the stop has been achieved, the supply must be disconnected. 
Application example: Motor with a DC brake or controlled drive.
\n122
12/22 PU05907001Z-ENDetermine the arrangement and number of such devices according to:
• The design of the machine.
• The necessity of the presence of persons in the danger zone.
• The risk assessment carried out in accordance with EN ISO 14121.
Also observe “Devices for switching off for prevention of unexpected 
startup”, clause 5.4 of IEC 60204-1.
Devices for the dissipation of stored energy or its retention
Devices for the dissipation of stored energy or its retention are, for 
example, brakes for movable parts, circuits for discharging capacitors, 
valves for pressure tanks.
Dissipation devices must be provided if stored energy can cause 
hazardous conditions.
Ensure that the energy dissipation or retention
• Occur at the same time as energy isolation.
• Do not cause hazardous conditions by themselves.
• Are described in the operating instructions.
• Can be checked for efficiency by the user (e.g. manometer).
Further measures
If the isolation/dissipation of energy is not appropriate for all operations, 
you can apply the following measures:
• Prevention of accidentally generated start command (example: Control 
circuit device with flush operating surface).
• Accidentally generated start commands must not cause an unexpected 
startup. STOP shall override START function.  
(Examples: Latched Emergency-stop actuator, key-operated actuator, 
opened movable protection door).
Figure 77: RMQ-Titan M22 keyswitches
• Automatic stop before a hazardous situation can occur. (example: 
A drive is only stopped with power electronics = Stop category 2 to 
IEC 60204-1. A zero speed monitoring function causes a disconnection 
via a contactor at the start of an unintentional movement.)
Danger!  
These measures are not a substitute for energy isolation 
and dissipation. They may only be used after a thorough risk 
assessment.Functional aspects
EN ISO 14118
Safety of machinery
Prevention of unexpected startup
Purpose
A machine must be protected against unexpected startups during the 
actions of a person in the danger zone. This standard stipulates design 
safety measures to protect against unexpected startups.
Target group
Machine designers and Type C standard makers.
Essential points in brief
The increasing level of automation in machines has increased the 
possibility of unexpected startups.
There are a considerable number of accidents in which machines have 
been stopped for fault finding or setting and which have started up 
unexpectedly.
Not only mechanical dangers due to movable parts must be taken into 
account, but also, for example, danger from radiation emitted by lasers.
Isolating and dissipating energy
Provide your machine with devices for isolation and energy dissipation.
Decommissioning, major maintenance work and work on power circuits 
must be carried out safely.
Devices for isolation
Devices for isolation must have the following characteristics:
• Isolate reliably.
• Transfer the operation of the actuator to the isolating element via a 
mechanically reliable connecting link.
• Indicate the switch position of the isolating element clearly, e.g. via the 
position of the operating element.
• Be lockable in the isolated position, for example with one or several 
padlocks. (A locking feature is not required if the restoration of the 
connection does not cause danger to persons.)
Main switches in accordance with IEC 60204-1 clause 5.3 meet these 
requirements.

Safety of machinery – Two-hand control devices – Functional aspects; 
Principles for design
Purpose
The two-hand control is a safety device. A design in compliance with the 
standard prevents access to the danger zones during hazardous processes.
Target group
Machine builders, manufacturers of two-hand controls and type C 
standard makers.
Essential points in brief
The standard specifies requirements and instructions for the design and 
the selection of two-hand controls. The appropriate type C standard and 
the risk evaluation ( ➔ EN ISO 12100 / EN ISO 14121).
The suitable two-hand control
Select the type and design of the two-hand control, depending on:
• The hazard concerned.
• The risk evaluation.
• The state of the application technology.
• Further influences such as prevention of accidental operation or 
bypassing of the safety feature.
No simple bypassing of the protection function or accidental 
actuation
Arrange the operating elements of the two-hand control so that the 
protection function cannot be bypassed easily. The possibility of 
accidental operation should also be reduced to a minimum.
The types of bypassing to be considered depend on:
• The design of the two-hand control.
• The actuation conditions.
• The type and location of mounting.
• The specified safety distances.
The standard shows some special procedures on how to prevent 
bypassing and accidental operation. The following examples are possible 
for different types of bypassing:• Operation with one hand
 –Inside distance between the operating elements ≧ 260 mm
f 260 mm
(f 10.24”)
Figure 78: Prevent bypassing of guard: Inside distance
• Operation with hand and elbow of the same arm
 –Inside distance between the operating elements min. 550 mm 
(≧ 600 mm)
 –Operating elements with different operation directions
• Operation with forearm and elbow
 –Use of covers or collars
Figure 79:  Prevent bypassing of the guard: Covers or collars
• Operation with one hand and any part of the body.
 –Operating elements on horizontal area min. 1100 mm above 
servicing level.
• Operation by blocking an operating element.
 –Use type II or type III.
These measures may not be compatible with ergonomic requirements. 
Make a careful decision here and take into account the “Safety first” 
principle!

Ensure the functioning in all operating and ambient conditions. Accidental 
START signals must not be generated in particular by impact, shock, 
falling etc. Provide two differently functioning operating elements on 
hand-held machines, preferably with a locking device. Portable two-hand 
controls in separate housings should be stable and secured against 
changes in their location. Protect the supply lines from damage.
Calculate the safety distance between two-hand controls and danger zone 
by means of the following points:
• Hand-arm speed rate (DIN EN 999/ISO 13855).
• Design and arrangement of the two-hand control.
• Response time of the two-hand control.
• Stopping time: Time between the termination of the output signal and 
the ending of the hazard.
• Intended use in accordance with EN ISO 12100.
• Relevant Type C standards.
Tests and information for use
Do the two-hand controls meet the requirements specified in the risk 
evaluation? This must be validated by means of a theoretical assessment 
as well as empirical tests. Table 2 of the EN ISO 13581 standard provides 
detailed requirements.
Provide additional information for the installation, operation and service 
preferably in the official language of the designer/operator. 
Mark the two-hand control with at least the type and the standard 
concerned.

12.5 Steps to the Performance Level PL in accordance with EN ISO 13849-1
The necessary risk reduction is achieved by the ability of safety-related 
parts of a control system (SRP/CS) to perform a safety function under 
foreseeable conditions. The iterative process in accordance with 
EN ISO 13849-1 should be used for the design of the SRP/CS. After the 
necessary safety functions are identified and their properties defined, the 
required PL is determined. The following example is designed to guide you 
in stages through the iterative process for determining the PL.

If this is only seldom and/or for a short period, choose F1 (maximum 1 x

For our example we choose F2.
A typical case of F2 is the intervention between the tools at regular 
intervals in order to remove or insert workpieces during cyclical operation. 
If access is only required from time to time, choose F1.
The last step deals with the question “What possibilities are there of 
avoiding the accident?”Step 1: Risk estimation
The degree of risk reduction determined by the risk estimation is stated as 
the required performance level PLr.
The risk estimation to determine the required performance level PLr 
assesses the machine without the safety functions provided.
The PLr is determined according to the EN ISO 13849-1 risk graph. The S, 
F and P parameters used are the same as those of the previously used 
standard EN 954-1 and determine the degree of risk reduction.

P1 should only be selected if there is a realistic chance of avoiding the 
accident or of significantly reducing its effects. P2 should be selected if 
there is almost no chance of avoiding the hazard. For our example we 
choose P2.
An accident is especially avoidable if the hazard can be detected.
Use the following points as a guide:
• Can the hazard be determined directly on account of its physical 
features or only by technical means such as indicators etc.?
• Does the hazard occur suddenly, quickly and unexpectedly or slowly and 
visibly?
• Can the accident be avoided by escaping or by the intervention of third 
parties?
• Are non-professionals or experts operating the machine?
• Is operation carried out with or without supervision?
• What practical safety experience relating to the process is available?
Result
The risk estimation results in a required performance level PLr = PL e.
This procedure is not mathematically exact but is accurate in terms of 
quality. An estimation process that usually provides an adequate degree 
of accuracy with little effort. Consider it as part of the risk evaluation in 
accordance with EN ISO 12100 and not as a replacement for it.12.5 The way to a safe machine\n131
12/22 PU05907001Z-EN• Category 3
A single fault in a safety-related part of the control system does not lead 
to the loss of the safety function. An accumulation of undetected faults 
may cause a hazardous situation on the machine, since not all faults must 
be detected. An example of this is the use of a redundant circuit without 
self monitoring.

must not lead to the loss of the safety function.

12/22 PU05907001Z-ENStep 3: Determining the achieved PL
Now determine the achieved performance level PL by assessing the 
following parameters:
Step 3.1: Control architecture (category)
Step 3.2: MTTFd – mean time to dangerous failure
Step 3.3: DC – diagnostic coverage
Step 3.4: CCF – common cause failure
Step 3.5: Relationship between the categories, MTTFd, DC, CCF and PL
Let us now carry out the evaluation on the basis of our example.
3.1 Assignment of control architecture (category)
First assign the selected safety function, Emergency-stop, to the control 
category created in step 2.
Now assign the individual function blocks input unit, logic unit and output 
unit to the elements of the block diagram.
Example
For our example: The input units 1 and 2 are formed by means of 
the Emergency-stop device M22-PVT ( → chapter 1.5 “Dual-channel 
with safety relay”, page 24), that has the following characteristics in 
conjunction with the logic unit:
• Reliable detection of open circuits on the cable and in the contact.
• Reliable detection of connection faults via the contact of a channel 
(fault on connection cable, short-circuit to 24 V).
• Reliable detection of cross-circuits between both input channels.
The ESR safety relay represents the logic function block. It provides 
diagnostics functions that also act on the input and output unit.
The output units Q1 and Q2 are formed by two DILM12 and DILM25 
contactors that are connected redundantly with cross-circuit detection to 
the logic unit ( → chapter 1.5 “Dual-channel with safety relay”, page 24).12.5 The way to a safe machineThe way to a safe machine

3.2 Determining the MTTFd
The MTTFd value represents the statistical mean value until the expected 
dangerous failure of the components. For electromechanical components, 
the MTTFd value depends primarily on the number of actuations. 
EN ISO 13849-1 provides the following calculation equation for this 
purpose:

1+1+1MTTF d, Input MTTF d, Logic MTTF d, Output
MTTF d, Input MTTF d, Logic MTTF Output;: Mean number of operating cycles up to 10% of the 
  components have failed dangerously. 
We will assume for our Emergency-stop safety function an operating 
frequency of 5 operations per day. The system is required to be in 
operation 360 days a year and two shifts per day, i.e. 16 hours per day.
This results in an nop of 1800 operating cycles.
The B10d value is specified by the component manufacturer. If no 
manufacturer specifications are available, Annex C EN ISO 13849-1 
provides an overview with typical values as a substitute.
Example
In our example we will set a B10d value for the Emergency-stop device of 
100000 cycles (manufacturer specification) a B10d value of 1.3·106 cycles 
(manufacturer specification).
This results in the following values for the individual subsystems:
• Input Unit: MTTFd, Input = 555.5 [years]
• Logic Unit: MTTFd, Logic  = 358 [years] (manufacturer specifications)
• Output Unit: MTTFd, Output  = 4858.6 [years]
Once all values of the individual components have been determined, 
determine the overall MTTFd value for each channel.MTTFd

  components have failed dangerously. 
If the values of both components are different, symmetrization by 
means of the equation D.2 from standard EN ISO 13849-1, Annex D. 
Symmetrization is not necessary for our example, since the structure of 
both channels is the same.
Result
The mean time to dangerous failure with the Emergency-stop safety 
function is around 208 years. The maximum to be taken into account 
by the standard is 100 years, which corresponds to a level based on 
EN ISO 13849-1 table 5 of MTTFd =“high”.3.3 Determining the diagnostic coverage (DC)
The safety integrity can be increased by the internal testing of the 
subsystems. The diagnostic coverage is a measure of fault detection 
efficiency. The DC can be determined for parts of the safety-related 
system or for the entire system.
If a safety-related control system consists of several parts, an average 
value DCavg is used for determining the achieved performance level. In 
complex systems a failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is necessary.
For simple systems, the standard supplies a simplified approach for 
determining the DC (see EN ISO 13849-1, Annex E).
Example
For our example, this means in real terms that we take the appropriate 
DC for the input, logic and output unit from the standard Table E.1.
The input unit is assigned the measure “Cross monitoring of inputs 
without dynamic test”, i.e. a value between 0 and 99 %. We will select 
99 % since a fault exclusion according to EN ISO 13849-2 is possible for 
the Emergency-stop device.
We select the measure Direct monitoring (monitoring of 
electromechanical devices by mechanically linked contact elements)”, 
which corresponds to a DC of 99 %. The DC of the logic unit is taken 
from the manufacturer’s specification of 99 %.
The average DCavg is calculated from the following equation:MTTFd

  components have failed dangerously. 
Result
The calculated average DC of the Emergency-stop device is 0.99 
and this corresponds to the denotation DCavg = “high” according to 
EN ISO 13849- 1 Table 6.\n134
12/22 PU05907001Z-EN→Faults and fault exclusion
A fault is characterized by the inability of an item of 
equipment to perform a required function. There are many 
types of faults which can theoretically occur. In practice you 
can however exclude some faults (see EN ISO 13849-2).
We have excluded the following faults in our example:
• Detaching of the auxiliary contact modules from the 
contactors
• Connection faults within the contactor circuit in the 
switching cabinet.
• Mechanical defect of the Emergency-stop actuator.
Reason: Protected mounting in the switching cabinet, well-
tried technology and overdimensioning.
Take into account the following fault criteria:
• If other components fail as a result of a fault, the first fault 
and all resulting faults must be considered as a single fault.
• Faults with the same cause are considered as a single fault.
• The simultaneous occurrence of two separate faults is not 
taken into account.Evaluating the avoidance of common cause failures provides a qualitative 
assessment of resistance to external influences (e.g. ambient conditions, 
such as temperature/vibration/humidity).
Measures against CCF must be implemented with multi-channel systems.
Table F.1 from the EN ISO 13849-1 standard, Annex F lists suitable 
measures for machinery and contains appropriate values based on an 
engineering assessment, representing the contribution of each measure to 
the reduction of common cause failures.
Example
The evaluation of our example is shown in the figure below.
Use the table with the points scoring system provided to assess the 
measures taken to avoid common cause failures on your safety-related 
control system.

Result
With the structure of category 4, our Emergency-stop device achieves an 
MTTFd “high” and a high DC and a performance level of PL e (see yellow 
area).Step 4: Verification of the achieved risk reductiong
The verification compares the achieved PL (step 3.5) with the required PLr 
(step 1).
If the comparison shows PL  PLr, the risk reduction is sufficient.
If the comparison shows a lesser value (PL < PLr), the iterative design 
process must be repeated.
Result
The achieved PL corresponds to the required PLr: 
PLr = PL e = PL
This determines the required risk reduction.
Step 5: Validation of the safety functions
Unlike the verification, the validation is a final confirmation that the 
requirements for the necessary risk reduction are fulfilled by using the 
selected safety functions.
Draw up a validation plan as to which analyses and tests you wish, to 
determine compliance of the solution with the requirements. Check in 
each case:
• Are all safety-related output signals generated in a correct and logical 
fashion by the input signals?
• Does the behaviour in the event of a fault comply with the defined 
categories?
• Depending on the complexity of the control system and the sequences 
involved, a theoretical test of the circuit diagrams is sufficient. 
Otherwise carry out a practical test with fault simulation.
• Are the control system and the devices dimensioned sufficiently for all 
operating modes and ambient conditions?

12.6  Steps to SIL safety integrity level according to EN IEC 62061
EN IEC 62061 covers the functional safety of safety-related electrical, 
electronic and programmable electronic control systems.
In the overall framework of EN ISO 12100 it serves as an alternative to 
EN ISO 13849-1 for the specification of the required safety performance of 
safety-related electrical control systems for the reduction of risks.
EN IEC 62061 is a sector specific standard beneath IEC 61508 and 
covers the entire life cycle of the machine (from the concept phase to 
dismantling) and describes the safety performance by means of the so-
called safety integrity level (SIL).
The latest edition of EN EN IEC 62601 can now also be applied to non-
electrical (e.g. hydraulic, pneumatic) safety-related control elements of 
machines.
The safety integrity requirements of a safety-related electrical control 
system (SRECS) are determined from the risk analysis.
The basic principle for risk reduction is achieved by means of an iterative 
process like EN ISO 13849-1.
The following iterative process from EN IEC 62061 describes the 
necessary procedures to sufficiently reduce the probability of systematic 
and random faults that can lead to a dangerous failure of the safety 
function.Which safety function is suitable for this and which control syste m
(SRECS) is used to implement it?
Document the selected control system
Implement the safety function following the documented steps .Which requirements (SIL) does a safety function (SRCF) have to  
fulfill in order to reduce the risk for a detected hazard ?
Validate the control system by means of suitable tests and 
analysis procedures.Step 1: "Risk assessment", page 137
Step 2: "Design of control system architecture", page 138
Step 3: "Determining the SIL",  page 139
Step 4: "Documentation, implementation and validation of th e
SRECS", page 145Could the selected control system achieve the required risk
reduction required by the risk assessment? no
yes

12/22 PU05907001Z-ENFor the example we will select the highest severity and assign the value 
Se = 4.
The probability of harm Cl is calculated as the sum of the individual 
parameters F, Pr and Av. The frequency and time of exposure to the hazard 
is in a range between >1 hour and < 1 day and is assigned the value F = 5. 
We shall estimate the probability of the occurrence of the hazardous event 
as seldom and assign it the value Pr = 2. We shall estimate the avoidance 
or limitation of the injury on entry as impossible and assign the value Av = 
5. This produces the following result:
Cl = Fr + Pr + Av = 5 + 2 + 5 = 12
Enter the calculated values in the standard table to EN IEC 62061 
(Annex A – Figure A.3).
The table shows the required safety integrity level for the safety function 
provided for risk reduction.
Result
For our Emergency-stop function we require a safety integrity level of 
SIL 3.Step 1: Risk assessment
The need for safety-related control functions (SRCF) in accordance with 
EN IEC 62061 and their specifications are derived from the risk analysis 
according to EN ISO 12100.
The risk evaluation should be carried in the same way as the 
EN ISO 13849-1 by the assessment of individual risk parameters. EN IEC 
62061 also considers the probability of the occurrence of a hazardous 
situation.
The analysis of the necessary risk reduction leads to a failure limit value 
for the probability of a dangerous failure per hour (PFHd) of each SRCF.
Risk parameters to EN IEC 62061:
• Severity of injury S
• Probability of the occurrence of damage as a function of:
 –Frequency and time of exposure of persons to the hazard.
 –Probability of occurrence of a hazardous event Pr.
 –Possibilities to limit or avoid the harm Av.
Example
An additional precautionary measure in the form of an emergency-stop 
function on a machine is required for a hazardous area.
First determine the severity of injury Se. A significantly irreversible or even 
fatal injury is assigned the value 4, a major irreversible injury the value 3, 
a reversible injury 2 and a minor injury the value 1.

Steps to SIL safety integrity level according to EN IEC 62061
Step 2: Design of the safety function
Now design a safety-related control function (SRCF) meeting the 
requirements of risk reduction with the integrity level SIL determined.
Examples of SRCF can be:
Monitoring movable guards such as a safety 
door, safety guard, protective cover
Enable safe operation with two-hand control
Monitor open hazardous area: e.g. with 
light matrix, light barriers/curtains, active 
 optoelectronic sensors.
Enable safe setting mode with manually 
actuated enabling device
Enable safe setting mode with foot operated 
enabling device
Emergency-Stop circuitsObserve the following criteria when developing and selecting the safety 
function:
• Features and characteristics of the machine, environment and persons 
operating this machine.
• Features of the machine design.
• Type and number of guards.
• Position and dimension of the guard (distance from the hazardous area, 
size of the protective field).
• Type and number of logic units (safety relay, safety control).
Example
We will select “Stopping in an emergency” for our example with the 
circuit from section 1.5 “Dual-channel with safety relay”, page 24.
The safety-related electrical control system (SREC) is then specified for 
each SRCF safety function:
Emergency stop Safety relays Safety contactors / 
contactors
Result
We will use a combination of M22-PVT emergency-stop actuator, ESR5 
safety relay and DIL…. safety contactors / contactors.
The achieved safety integrity SIL must now be defined for the 
designed safety function.12.6 The way to a safe machine\n139
12/22 PU05907001Z-ENStep 3: Determining the SIL
After the safety-related control function SRCF is designed, the achieved 
safety integrity level SIL of the safety function is determined in order to 
determine the required risk reduction on the basis of the risk analysis.  
The determination of the safety integrity is carried out taking the following 
criteria into account:
• Probability of dangerous random hardware failure per hour (PFHd).
• Architectural constraints for safety integrity of the hardware.
• Requirements for systematic safety integrity.
The following additional considerations are necessary to determine these 
criteria.
3.1 Determining the subsystem architectures
The EN IEC 62061 standard provides a number of basic subsystem 
architectures for a simple approach to determining the probability of 
dangerous hardware failure.
The subsystem can consist of one or several subsystem elements. The 
EN IEC 62061 standard defines a subsystem element as the part of a 
subsystem, which comprises an individual or a group of components.
The standard provides 4 different subsystem architectures (A,B,C,D) 
that offer different hardware fault tolerances (HFT) and the diagnostic 
functions provided. Appropriate calculation equations for each of these 
architectures are specified in the EN IEC 62061 standard.
• Basic subsystem architecture A:  
Zero fault tolerance, without diagnostic function
Each failure of a subsystem element causes a failure of the SRCF. This 
results in a hardware fault tolerance HFT = 0. A diagnostic function is not 
provided.• Basic subsystem architecture B:  
Single fault tolerance, without diagnostic function
A single fault of a subsystem element does not cause the loss of safety 
function. A hazardous fault in more than one element can cause the 
loss of the safety function (HFT = 1). The calculation also considers the 
susceptibility to common cause failures (ß).

Each hazardous fault of a subsystem element that is undetected causes 
the loss of the safety function. The DC diagnostic coverage is therefore 
also included.

common cause failures, the diagnostic interval T2 and the lifetime T1.Subsystem architecture ASubsystem

Steps to SIL safety integrity level according to EN IEC 62061
3.2 Determining safety characteristics of the subsystems
The required characteristics must be determined for each subsystem 
to calculate the probability of a dangerous failure per hour PFHd for 
subsystem architecture D.
The subsystems are described by the following characteristics:
SIL CL SIL claim limit
PFHd Probability of a dangerous failure per hour
T1 Lifetime
The individual subsystem elements are described by the following 
characteristics:
λd Dangerous failure rate
β Characteristic value for the common cause failure
DC Diagnostic coverage
T2 Diagnostic test interval
SFF Safe Failure Fraction
The individual characteristics must not be determined if the PFHd value is 
specified directly by the manufacturer.
Example
In our example, this applies to the subsystem SS2 – safety relay. The 
manufacturer’s specifications can be considered for the intended use of 
the certified ERS5 safety relay. These are specified as:

Equations are provided for subsystem elements of the same

switched at the same frequency (start/stop function is ignored). There is 
a hardware fault tolerance of HFT = 1 for the subsystems.12.6 The way to a safe machine\n141

Steps to SIL safety integrity level according to EN IEC 62061
3.2.1 Determining the dangerous failure rate (λd) of the 
 individual subsystem elements
The subsystem elements in the subsystems SS1 and SS3 are formed from 
electromechanical components. The dangerous failure rate λd of each 
subsystem element with electromechanical components is calculated with 
the following equations:
λ =0.1 x C
B10
λ =Total failure rate per hour.
C= Switching frequency of the application per hour.
B10 = Number of operations, up to 10 % of the electromechanical
             devices tested that have failed (manufacturers' specifications).
λd=λ x Rate of dangerous failures
λd=Dangerous failure rate per hour.
→The ratio of dangerous failures is stated in this manual in the 
chapters 1…6 as a ratio of λd/λ.
The parameter C represents the operating cycles specified for the 
application.
If the B10 value is not specified by the manufacturer, an overview of 
typical failure rates for electrical components can be found in standard  
EN ISO 13849-1, Annex C.1.
B10 values can be calculated by using the conversion factor of 0.5 
specified there.
Example
Emergency-stop device SS1 and contactor SS3:
• Operating frequency C for two 8-hour shifts per day and an actuation 
frequency of 5 actuations per day: C = 0.3125 operations per h
• B10 value: 20000 for SS1 / 975,000 for SS3
• Ratio of dangerous failures: 20 % for SS1 / 75 % for SS3 
Result
• For the subsystem element of the Emergency-stop device  
TS1: λd = 3.125 x 10-7
• For the subsystem element of the contactors  
TS3: λd = 2.404 x 10-812.6 The way to a safe machine3.2.2 Determining the diagnostic coverage (DC)
Each subsystem of our example must be equipped with the associated 
diagnostic functions required to meet the requirements of the architectural 
constraints and the probability of dangerous hardware failures.  
To estimate the DC, the rate of detected dangerous failures is divided by 
the rate of total dangerous failures.
Result
• For SS1: A DC of 99% is assumed for subsystem SS1 based on 
the estimation of single fault probabilities and the manufacturing 
specifications for the Emergency-stop actuator in accordance with 
IEC 60947-5-1.
• For SS2: If the DC of the manufacturer is specified and assuming 
intended use SS2 = 99 %.
• For SS3: A redundant disconnection stage with contactors is 
implemented. Provided that both contactors are mounted within a 
protected mounting area together with the logic unit and provided 
that the probability is estimated, we shall set the DC of the 
subsystem SS 3 at 99 %.
3.2.3 Determining common cause failures CCF (β)
With multi-channel subsystems, measures are required to avoid common 
cause failures.
Table F.1 in Annex F of the EN IEC 62601 standard provides estimation 
criteria for the design of the subsystem. The listed criteria are assessed 
with a scoring system. The overall score calculated from the table F.2 of 
factors of common cause failures (β).
Table 4: Factor of the rate of common cause failures
Score CCF factor (β)
< 35 10 % (0.1)
35 - 65 5 % (0.05)
65 - 85 2 % (0.02)
85 - 100 1 % (0.01)
Result
With an overall score of 57 points the CCF factor is β = 0.05.\n143
12/22 PU05907001Z-EN3.2.4 Determining the interval for the proof test or the
lifetime T1 per hour
The proof test is a repeated test that enables faults to be detected in a 
safety-related electrical control system SRECS. A proof test confirms that 
the SRECS is in a condition that guarantees the specified safety integrity. 
The proof test sets the SRECSs and the subsystems to an “as new state” 
if required.
The standard refers at this point to EN ISO 13849-1 and recommends a 
lifetime of 20 years.
Result
We shall use a proof test interval of 20 years and calculate the appropriate 
lifetime of:
T1 = 20 years x 365 days x 24 hours = 175200 h
3.2.5 Determination of the diagnostic test interval T2
The diagnostic test interval T2 is stated in hours and is the period 
between two diagnostic tests carried out by the system. The diagnostic 
test interval of each subsystem with a hardware fault tolerance of more 
than zero (HFT = 1), must be selected so that the subsystem can meet the 
requirements for the probability of a random hardware fault.
Result
The diagnostic tests of the subsystems SS1 and SS3 in our example are 
carried out when the contacts are triggered. This produces a test rate 
from the hourly actuation of both subsystem elements.
With a daily use of two shifts, i.e. 16 hours and 5 actuations, the 
diagnostic test interval of T2 = 3.2 hours of both subsystem elements.3.2.6 Determining the probability of dangerous failure of the 
subsystems PFHd
The single fault probabilities of the subsystems must be calculated from 
the individual subsystem elements in order to determine the total failure 
rate.
The dangerous failure rate of each subsystem can then be converted to an 
hourly rate.
Example
The following characteristic values can be combined from the previous 
steps:
Subsystem TS1 Subsystem TS2 Subsystem TS3
λd 3.125 x 10-7PFHd value 
is specified 
directly by the 
manufacturer.2.404 x 10-8
DC 99 % 99 %
T2 3.2 h 3.2 h
T1 175200 h 175200 h
β 0.05 0.05
The subsystems SS1 and SS3 have both elements with the same design 
so that the equation for structures with the same design must be used 
here.
λd, TS = (1 - β)2 {[λd2 x 2 x DC] x T2/2 + [λd2 x (1 - DC)] x T1} + β x λd
PFHd = λd, TS x 1h
Result
The probability of a dangerous failure per hour is as follows for:
• TS1: PFHd = 1.58 x 10-8
• TS2: PFHd = 7.2 x 10-9 (manufacturer’s specification)
• TS3: PFHd = 1.2 x 10-9
The SIL for each subsystem is determined with the calculated PFHd values 
using following Table from the standard.
Table 5: Determining the SIL of each subsystem

Result
The subsystems SS1 and SS3 of our example can each be assigned an 
integrity level of SIL 3.

12/22 PU05907001Z-ENThe way to a safe machine
Steps to SIL safety integrity level according to EN IEC 62061
Result
Both subsystems TS1 and TS3 comply with the highest safety integrity 
level SIL 3.
The SIL claim limit SIL CL = 3 is determined from the comparison of the 
SIL results for SS1 and SS3 from step 3.2.6 (SIL3) and step 3.2.7 (SIL3).
Determined by the parameters SFF and HFT, it does not restrict the 
safety integrity of the subsystems. Each subsystem can be assigned SIL 
CL 3 for the safety integrity of the SRCF.
If the SIL values are different, the lowest value is the SIL CL of the 
subsystem.
3.3 Determining the SIL for the entire SRECS
To assess the entire safety function, the safety integrity of the hardware 
is determined by the parameters PFHd and SIL CL of the individual 
subsystems.

The SIL CL denotes the maximum SIL that can be claimed for a subsystem 
of the safety function in relation to architectural constraints and 
systematic safety integrity.
To determine the SIL CL, the hardware fault tolerance HFT and the safe 
failure fraction SFF are required.
• Safe failure fraction SFF
The SFF is defined as the ratio of the sum of failure rates for safe and 
dangerous failures detected to the overall failure rate.
A failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) must be carried out for each 
subsystem in order to estimate the SFF.

The following table can be used with the SFF and HFT values to determine 
the highest SIL value that the subsystems can claim.

12/22 PU05907001Z-EN3.3.1 Probability of dangerous failure of the entire safety 
function PFHd
The probability of a dangerous hardware failure of the SRECS is the sum 
of the individual probabilities of all subsystems that are involved in the 
execution of the safety function.
PFHd = PFHd, TS1 + PFHd, TS2 + PFHd, TS3 +… + PFHd, TSn
Result
If the individual probabilities of the subsystems SS 1 to SS 3 of our 
example are added together, this produces the following total probability 
of dangerous failures:
PFHd = 2.42 x 10-8
This value would correspond to a safety integrity level of SIL 3 in 
accordance with EN IEC 62601, Table 3. An integral evaluation of the 
safety integrity of the safety function must also include the architectural 
constraint.
3.3.2 Examination of the architectural constraints for the 
entire system
The SIL for the entire system achieved by the SRECS on the basis of 
architectural constraints must be less than or equal to the lowest SIL CL  
of a subsystem that is involved in the execution of the SRCF.
The design process must be repeated if the achieved SIL of the safety 
function is not the same as the SIL required by the risk estimation.
Result
The individual subsystems SS1/SS2/SS3 in our example each have SIL 
CL 3. The entire Emergency-stop system therefore achieves a safety 
integrity level of SIL 3.
(alternative example: An SIL CL 2 for SS 1 would lower the resulting DIL 
of the entire system to SIL 2.)
→Faults and fault exclusion  
Provided that the probability of their occurrence is low, specific 
faults can be excluded. Each individual fault exclusion must be 
substantiated sufficiently and documented.
It is also permissible to exclude faults in accordance with the 
EN ISO 13849-2 standard.Step 4: Documentation, implementation and validation of the 
SRECS
The architecture of the SRECS with your assignment of subsystems, 
subsystem elements, safety functions and their interrelationships must be 
documented.
The implementation is the use of the SRECS in accordance with the 
documented SRECS design.
Ensure that the following requirements are observed:
• The appropriate parts of the SRECS safety requirements.
• The relevant requirements for wiring and cabling practice in accordance 
with IEC 60204-1
• The requirements for avoiding systematic hardware failures.
• The requirements for controlling systematic failures.
During the validation, the inspection and testing ensure that the design of 
each SRCF safety function meets the requirements of the specification.
The validation of the safety-related electrical control system according to 
a previously specified validation plan.
Each safety-related control function must be included and validated with 
suitable tests and analysis procedures. Adequate documentation must 
then be created, containing information on test and analysis procedures as 
well as the results and if necessary corrections and retests.
The documentation must be:
• Accurate and concise.
• Understood by those persons that have to work with it.
• Accessible.
• Easy to maintain.
The EN IEC 62601 standards provides further information on “validation 
and documentation”.

12/22 PU05907001Z-EN13 Appendix
13.1 Glossary of terms
Access time (time for access to the danger zone) (ISO 14119)
The required time for access to the dangerous machine parts after the 
initiation of the stop command by the interlock, calculated on the basis 
of the speed of approach for which the value can be selected for each 
individual case, taking into account the parameters in DIN EN 999/ISO 
13855 “Safety of machinery – The positioning of protective equipment in 
respect of approach speeds of parts of the human body.”
Active opto-electronic protective device (AOPD) (IEC 61496-2)
A device in which the sensor function is generated by opto-electronic 
sender and receiver units. The interruption of the light generated in the 
device by an opaque object within the defined protective field (with a light 
barrier: On the axis of the light beam) generates a stop signal.
AOPDs work either according to the single mode principle, in which the 
light beam crosses the protected area once, or according to a reflecting 
two-way principle by which the light beam crosses the protected area 
more than once.
Actuator (operating element) (IEC 60204-1)
The part of the operating system on which an external actuating force  
is applied.
The actuator may take the form of a handle, knob, push-button, roller, 
plunger etc. (IEV 441-15-22).
There are many actuating means which do not require an external 
actuating force but only an action.
See also machine actuator, IEC 60204-1, 3.36.
Actuator, operating element
Mechanical element of a safety position switch or a safety interlocking 
device which initiates the switching operation. Due to their design, the 
position switches and actuators are coded so that manipulation with

with different technologies and external devices to minimize risk.
Guard (EN ISO 12100-1)
Physical barrier, designed as part of the machine, to provide protection.
A guard may act:
• Alone; it is then only effective when it is “closed” for a movable guard 
or “securely held in place” for a fixed guard;
• In conjunction with an interlocking device with or without guard 
locking; in this case, protection is ensured whatever the position of the 
guard.
Depending on its design, a guard may be called e.g. casing, shield, cover, 
screen, door, enclosing guard.
See EN ISO 12100-2:2003; 5.3.2. and ISO 14120 for types of guards and 
their requirements.
Hazard (EN ISO 12100-1)

The term “hazard” can be qualified in order to define its origin (e.g. 
mechanical hazard, electrical hazard) or the nature of the potential harm 
(e.g. electric shock hazard, cutting hazard, toxic hazard, fire hazard).
Hazard envisaged in this definition:
• Either is permanently present during the intended use of the machine 
(e.g. motion of hazardous moving elements, electric arc during a 
welding phase, unhealthy posture, noise emission, high temperature);
• Or may appear unexpectedly (e.g. explosion, crushing hazard as a 
consequence of an unintended / unexpected startup, ejection as a 
consequence of a breakage, fall as a consequence of acceleration / 
deceleration).

A fault is often the result of a failure of the item itself, but may exist 
without prior failure.
Fault exclusion
Fault exclusion is a compromise between technical safety requirements 
and the theoretical possibility of occurrence of a fault.
Fault exclusion can be based on
• the technical improbability of occurrence of some faults,
• generally accepted technical experience, independent of the considered 
application, and
• technical requirements related to the application and the specific 
hazard.
If faults are excluded, a detailed justification shall be given in the 
technical documentation.

12/22 PU05907001Z-ENInherent stability
Property of a switching device that switches off at specified voltages at 
a current expected in the event of a short-circuit (the prospective short-
circuit current) at any level (greater than 100 kA), without being affected in 
its function (conducting current, tripping in the event of an overload).
Inherent stability is normally obtained by damping components in the 
switching device which reduce a short-circuit current so that it can be 
switched off by the contact system. With circuit-breakers and motor-
protective circuit-breakers for small rated operating currents, this is 
caused by the resistance in the bimetal trip and in the winding of the 
short-circuit release. Larger switching devices obtain this effect by the 
fast and wide opening of the contacts, leading quickly to an arc resistance 
which also limits the current. Inherent stability mainly applies to switching 
devices with small rated currents due to the increasing mass inertia of the 
contact system of large circuit-breakers.

operate until the guard is closed;
• If the guard is opened while hazardous machine functions are 
operating, a stop command is given;
When the guard is closed, the hazardous machine functions “covered” by

operate until the guard is closed and locked;
• The guard remains closed and locked until the risk due to the hazardous 
machine functions “covered” by the guard has disappeared;

such as switching on a laser beam.STOP – Category 0 (IEC 60204-1)Stopping by immediate disconnection of the supply to the machine drives (e.g. uncontrolled stop).
STOP – Category 1 (IEC 60204-1)
Controlled stop where the supply to the machines is maintained to obtain the standstill status and the supply is only disconnected if the standstill status is achieved.
STOP – Category 2 (IEC 60204-1)
Controlled stop in which the supply to the machine drives is maintained.
Stop, controlled (IEC 60204-1)
The stopping of machine motion by setting the command signal to “0” once the stop signal has been recognized by the control system but retaining power to the machine actuators during the stopping process.
Stopping in case of emergency (EN ISO 13850)
Function intended to prevent hazards or minimize existing risks for people or of damage to machines or running processes, and which is triggered by a single action by one person.
Stopping time, time up to removal of the hazard (ISO 14119)
T
ime from the release of the stop command by the interlocking device to 
the point when the risk caused by the hazardous machine function is no longer present.
Stopping, uncontrolled (IEC 60204-1)
The stopping of machine motion by removing power to the machine actuators, all brakes or other mechanical stopping devices being activated.
Switching device (IEC 60204-1)
Device for switching the current on or off in one or several circuits 
(IEV 441-14-01).
Synchronous actuation (EN ISO 13581)
A special case of simultaneous actuation where the time shift between the start of the input signal and the start of the other signal is less or equal to 0.5 s.

Undervoltage release (IEC 60947-1/IEV 441-16-42)A release which permits a mechanical switching device to open or close, with or without time-delay
, when the voltage across the terminals of the 
release falls below a predetermined value.
Undervoltage releases are used in emergency-stop devices, as a method 
of preventing restart after a voltage failure and in electrical interlocking devices.
Unexpected/unintended startup (EN ISO 12100-1)
Any unexpected startup that causes a hazard. This can be for example 
due to:
•
A start command which is the result of a failure in, or an external
influence on, the control system;
•A start command generated by inopportune action on a start control
or other parts of the machine, such as a sensor or a power control
element;
•Restoration of the power supply after an interruption;
•External / internal influences (e.g. gravity , wind, self-ignition in internal
combustion engines) on parts of the machine.
Machine startup during normal sequence of an automatic cycle is not unintended, but can be considered to be unexpected from the point of view of the operator
. Prevention of accidents in this case involves the use 
of safeguarding measures.
User information (EN ISO 12100-1)
Protective measures consisting of communication elements (such as texts, words, characters, signals, symbols, graphs), which are used individually or jointly to provide information to the user.
Voltage tolerance
Term for the operating reliability of a magnetic drive in terms of the limit values the applied actuating voltage.
A contactor has a satisfactory operating voltage tolerance if it is switched 
by the smallest permissible actuating voltage (pick-up voltage = seal-in voltage). A relatively low voltage is required for disconnection, so that no accidental switch conditions occur in the event of voltage failures. The drop-out voltage, however, may not be too low as with long control cables, is possible that the sealing current can flow even after opening the control contact, due the capacitance in the conductors, and the drop off is at least delayed.
Zero fault tolerance (EN IEC 62601)
Any undetected dangerous fault of the subsystem element leads to a dangerous failure of the SRCF.T2 (EN IEC 62601)Diagnostic test interval

as screwdrivers, bolts, pieces of wire.”
2.
 An Emergency-stop device is tamper -proof if an executed release
operation cannot be cancelled without auxiliary means or prescribedprocedures. The switching device locks in the release position. The
accidental or controlled manipulation (inching) is excluded.
Two-hand control (EN 574)
A device that requires at least the simultaneous operation by both hands, to initiate and maintain the operation of a machine as long as a hazard is present, in order to achieve a protective measure solely for the operator.
Two-hand control, portable (EN 574)
A movable device which can be used in more than one specified position, in relation to the danger zone area of the machine which it controls.
Type A standards (EN ISO 12100-1)
These standards (safety basic standards) contain basic concepts, design principles general aspects which apply to all machines, devices and systems.
Type B standards (EN ISO 12100-1)
These standards (safety group standards) deal with a safety aspect or a kind of device required for more safety which can be used for a number of machines, devices and systems:
•
Type B1 standards for certain safety aspects (e.g. safety distances,
surface temperature noise);
•Type B2 standards for guards (e.g. two-hand controls, interlock devices,
pressure-sensitive guards, mechanically separating guards).
T
ype C standards (EN ISO 12100-1)
These standards (machine safety standards) contain detailed safety 
requirements for a certain machine or groups of machines.

12/22 PU05907001Z-ENThis interpretation paper is the version of the interpretation paper by 
the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (BMA) and the German states, revised as required for the new German Product Safety Act1 (ProdSG) and based on the latest insights from risk assessments, on the subject of “Substantial Modifications to Machinery,” Announcement of the BMA from September 7, 2000  - IIIc3-39607-3  - Bundesarbeitsblatt (German Federal Labor Law Gazette) 11/2000, p. 35.ProdSG governs the provision of products on the market. These products include machinery. Together with the Ninth Ordinance to the Product Safety Act (Maschinenverordnung  - 9. ProdSV), ProdSG sets forth the requirements that machines must meet when they are provided on the market. 9. ProdSV and ProdSG incorporate the applicable European Directive, i.e., the Machinery Directive, into German law.
Any modification to a machine, regardless of whether the machine is used 
or new, that may prejudice the legal rights set forth in ProdSG, e.g, as a result of output increases, functional changes, changes in intended use, etc., must first be assessed in terms of its safety-relevant impact. This means that it is necessary to determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the modification to the (used) machine has resulted in new hazards or whether an existing risk has been increased.
Three different scenarios can be assumed:1.
 There is no new hazard or no increased risk so that the machine can still
be considered as safe.
2.
 There is a new hazard or an increased risk, but the machine’ s safety
measures that existed before the modification are sufficient for the
machine to continue to be deemed safe.
3.
 There is a new hazard or an increased risk, and the existing safety
measures are not sufficient to deal with it.
Additional safety measures are not required in the case of altered 
machines that fall under case 1 or 2. In contrast, altered machines that fall under case 3 must be evaluated with a risk assessment in order to determine whether there is a substantial modification.
The first step is to determine whether it is possible to make the machine 
safe again with the use of simple protective devices, i.e., so that the risk does not increase in comparison to the machine’
s original safe condition. 
If this is the case, the modification can generally be considered not to be substantial. Otherwise, a more extensive risk assessment must be conducted.
A “simple protective device” within this context can be, for instance, a 
fixed guard. Movable guards and safety devices that do not significantly affect the machine’s existing safety controller are also considered simple protective devices. “Do not significantly affect” means that these protective devices are simply used to connect signals that the existing safety controller is already designed to process or that they only bring about the safe stopping of the machine function posing the hazard independently of the existing safety controller. Interpretation paper of the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs on the subject of „Substantial Modifications to Machinery“ [„Wesentliche Veränderung von Maschinen“] (Announcement of the German Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs from April 9, 2015 concerning the German Product Safety Act / Ninth Ordinance to the Product Safety Act [9. ProdSV])
Replacing machine components with identical components or with components with the exact same function and safety level, as well as installing protective devices that result in an increase in the machine’s safety level and that do not provide any additional functions, is not considered making substantial modifications.
Note: 
Regardless of this, other legal regulations may require employers that provide their employees with machinery for use as work equipment to establish additional safety measures.
Generally, a risk assessment must be conducted in accordance 
with § 3 of the German Ordinance on Industrial Safety and Health 9 (Betriebssicherheitsverordnung 9) after any modifications are made to machines, including modifications that are not considered substantial. This assessment is part of the industrial occupational health and safety obligations of any user of a machine or system using this machine or system as work equipment. This risk assessment may render measures  - especially technical measures  - necessary in order to provide employees with safe work equipment.
It is necessary to determine whether the information on how to safely 
operate the machines, e.g., the operating instructions, needs to be modified as well.
Conclusion:
Modifications to a machine/assembly of machinery can have the following effects:
1.
 The machine continues to be safe after the modification even without
additional safety measures.
➔These is no substantial modification.
2.
 After the modification, the machine is no longer safe without additional
safety measures. The new hazard or increased risk can be eliminated, or
at least sufficiently minimized, with simple protective devices.
➔These is no substantial modification.
3.
 After the modification, the machine is no longer safe without additional
safety measures, and simple protective devices will not be enough to
reduce the risk sufficiently

Application of the Machinery Directive (MD) for old or series 
machines
Old machines are considered as in the interpretation paper of the Federal 
Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs and the states on the “Significant 
modification of machines”. In this case, the application of the MD depends 
on the scope of modifications of the machine.
The series produced machines are subject directly to the MD provisions.
The new Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC has been in force since 
29.12.2009. A machine that was modified considerably as described above 
and was brought into circulation after 29.12.2009 must comply with the 
requirements of the new MD. The validity of the previous MD 98/37/EC 
elapsed on 28.12.2009.\n160

12/22 PU05907001Z-ENSafety of controls on machines –  
simple calculation with Eaton libraries
The manufacturer -independent calculation tool SISTEMA from the 
Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the German Social 
Accident Insurance (IF A) provides assistance in the evaluation of 
safety-related control components in the context of EN ISO 13849-1 
and simpliﬁes risk assessment analysis.
Selection of the design structure of the protective devices and 
the assignment to an architecture compliant to the EN ISO 13849-
1 is implemented in a Windows user interface. On this basis, the 
software calculates the reliability values as well as the attained 
Performance Level (PL). A direct comparison with the required Per -
formance Level (PLr) is thus possible.
The software records the relevant parameters for evaluation such 
as MTTFd, B10d, DCavg and CCF . It directly indicates the inﬂuence 
of variable parameters on the overall result.
The calculation tool can be downloaded directly from the IF A web -
site.
Eaton provides the libraries for integration into the SISTEMA soft -
ware free-of-charge under: Input, Logic or Output. The individual 
libraries can be downloaded at www .eaton.eu/safety.  Please note 
that the libraries are updated on an ongoing basis and new pro -
ducts are continuously added.
Eaton provides you the librairies free-of-charge: Eaton.com/safety– The evaluations and calculations must be conducted by the
machine manufacturer (as the distributor) and be veriﬁably docu -
mented.
– The device manufacturers supply the relevant data (parameters)
of the safety devices used in the machine from the point of view
of product liability .
– Safety calculations can be performed with the aid of calculation
tools (software programs).
Applying the aforementioned standards requires that relevant data 
is exchanged between the machinery manufacturers, device ma -
nufacturers and calculation tools involved.
Device Manufacturers
create a parameters library in the form of a „Universal Database“ 
and make it generally available. Only the device manufacturer may 
also be the creator of a parameters library .
Calculation tools
provide an import mechanism for the parameters libraries in the 
database format. The parameters are prepared for presentation 
and selection in the tool.
Machinery manufacturers
use the parameters library (ﬁle) made available by the device ma -
nufacturer to import the parameters (device data) into the calcula-
tion tool and for updating.
This makes the universal database according to VDMA 66413 the 
common basis by which information is exchanged.
Following is a summary of the most important criteria:
– Deﬁnition of required information
– Clear description of device data, manufacturer -independent
– Appropriate for machine building, industry-independent
– Independent of physical interfaces, calculation tools, transfer
protocols, database formatsfor Sistema for VDMA 66413
The as per 2006/42/EC Machinery Safety Directive harmonized 
standards EN IS 13849-1, EN ISO 13849-2 and EN IEC 62061 require 
evaluations and calculations relating to the likelihood of a dangerous 
failure and systematic aspects of a machine‘s safety functions .\nEaton Industries GmbH
