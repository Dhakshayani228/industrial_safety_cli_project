•Question 1: How does your group define terminology (e.g., 
ontologies, glossaries, something else)?
•Question 2: How do you define the following terms (as 
appropriate): robot, automated robot, teleoperated robot, 
environment, pose?
•Question 3: How did you determine these definitions (e.g., 
adopted from other standards, consensus among group 
members, something else )?\nRIA’s Definitions
•Question 1: How does your group define terminology (e.g., 
ontologies, glossaries, something else)?
•RIA response: English language/ natural language consensus 
definitions
–For the Broader Industry: RIA/ A3 actively participates in IFR’s vocabulary efforts
–For Standards: RIA’s Standards definitions generally follow R15.06/10218, + ISO 8373 
where applicable
•RIA Standards: English language/ natural language consensus 
definitions
–Consult ISO 8373:2012, Robots and Robotic Devices -Vocabulary
–Consult ISO 10218- 1,2:2011, Robots and Robotic Devices -Industrial robots and robot 
systems – Safety requirements\nRIA’s Standards Definitions
•Question 2: How do you define the following terms (as 
appropriate): robot, automated robot, teleoperated robot, 
environment, pose?
Term Definition Source
Robot actuated mechanism programmable in two or 
more axes (4.3) with a degree of autonomy 
(2.2), moving within its environment, to perform 
intended tasks [There are 2 Notes]ISO 8373:2012
Industrial robot automatically controlled, reprogrammable (2.4), 
multipurpose (2.5) manipulator (2.1), 
programmable in three or more axes (4.3), 
which can be either fixed in place or mobile for 
use in industrial automation applications 
[There are 4 Notes in the 10218 version]ISO 8373:2012; 
10218 -1,2:2011 
(adapted)\nRIA’s Standards Definitions
•Question 2: How do you define the following terms (as 
appropriate): robot, automated robot, teleoperated robot, 
environment, pose?
Term Definition Source
Automated robot We do not use this term; in our general usage, 
all robots are “automated”; autonomy is a key 
part of our conception of a “robot”
Teleoperated
robotWe do not use this term; the closest related 
terms are “teleoperation” (8373) and “manual 
mode” (10218)
Environment We do not use this term; the closest related 
term is “normal operating conditions” (8373)\nRIA’s Standards Definitions
•Question 2: How do you define the following terms (as 
appropriate): robot, automated robot, teleoperated robot, 
environment, pose?
Term Definition Source
Pose Combination of position and orientation in 
space [There are 2 Notes]
There are also a number of related terms, e.g., 
command pose, attained pose, path, trajectory ISO 8373:2012\nRIA’s Standards Definitions
•Question 3: How did you determine these definitions (e.g., 
adopted from other standards, consensus among group 
members, something else)?
•RIA Response: Adopted from ISO 10218 and 8373; participated 
in the development of the natural language definitions in 10218 
by consensus among group members, which then fed into the 
first version of 8373.\nRobotic Industries Association (RIA)
