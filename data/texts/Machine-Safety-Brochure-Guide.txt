\n4 5There are various guides to machinery safety 
legislation which tend to present a distorted view of the requirements of that legislation. 
This handbook is an attempt to provide information that is up-to-date and unbiased 
in order to help machine builders and users to provide workers with machines that are safe, legal, and efficient. It is not intended as an exhaustive guide to compliance with safety legislation, nor as a replacement for referring to the relevant standards themselves; it is to guide you through the logical steps and to point you to the relevant sources of information.Introduction\n6 7As well as the moral obligation to avoid harming anyone, 
there are laws that require machines to be safe, and sound economic reasons for avoiding accidents.
Safety must be taken into account right from the design stage and must be kept in mind at 
all stages in the life of a machine: design, manufacture, installation, adjustment, operation, maintenance and eventual scrapping.
New machines - the Machinery Directive
From 29 December 2009 the new Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC compels machine 
manufacturers to meet a minimum set of requirements before a machine may be placed on the market within the EEA. 
Machines have to comply with the Essential Health and Safety Requirements (EHSRs) listed in 
Annex I of the Directive, thus setting a common minimum level of protection across the EEA (European Economic Area). 
Machine manufacturers, or their authorised representatives within the EU, must ensure that the 
machine is compliant, the Technical File can be made available to the enforcing authorities on request, the CE marking is affixed, and a Declaration of Conformity has been signed, before the machine may be placed on the market within the EAA.Design/manufacture Installation Adjustment/operation MaintenanceWhy safety\n8 9
9Existing machines – the Work Equipment Directive
The user has obligations defined by the Use of Work Equipment directive 89/655/EEC which 
can in most cases be met by using machinery compliant with relevant standards. 
It applies to the provision of all work equipment, including mobile and lifting equipment, in all 
workplaces and work situations. 
It requires that all equipment is suitable for use, and is inspected and maintained as necessary 
to ensure that it remains so.
The cost of accidents
Some of the costs are obvious, such as sick pay for injured employees, whereas some costs are harder to identify. The Health and Safety Executive in UK (HSE) give an example of an accident at a drilling machine that resulted in costs to the business of £45 000 (~51 300 €) (HSE INDG355). However this does not include some of the less obvious costs, and some estimates amount to double that figure. An accident analysed by Schneider Electric Ltd, the outcome of which was a reversible head injury, cost the employer some £90 000 (~102 600 €), of which only £37 000 (~42 200 €) was insurable. The full financial impact can include increase in insurance premiums, lost production, lost customers and even loss of reputation.
Some risk reduction measures can actually increase productivity; 
for example the use of light curtains to protect access points of machines can allow easier access for loading and unloading; zoning of isolation devices can allow parts of a machine to be shut down for maintenance while other parts remain productive. The regulations apply to all employers, the self-employed, and others who have control of the provision of work equipment. \n10 11 10Presumption of conformity: 
 When a product conforms to a harmonised European standard, the reference to which has 
been published in the Official Journal of the European Union for a specific Directive, and which 
covers one or more of the essential safety requirements, the product is presumed to comply with those essential safety requirements of the Directive.
 In many cases European standards (ENs) are technically very similar to International (IEC or 
ISO) standards. However only European standards include a list of which EHSRs are covered, 
so only European standards can confer a Presumption of Conformity.A list of such standards can be accessed athttp://www.newapproach.org/Directives/DirectiveList.aspEC Directive:

Standard:
 A “standard” is a technical specification approved by a recognised standardisation body for  
 repeated or continuous application, with which compliance is not compulsory
Harmonised standard:

It is of course 
necessary to ensure compliance with all the other EHSRs as well as those for which a Presumption of Conformity is given by the use of a specific standard.Legal framework\n12 13European Directives and Safety Standards
Link between some of the main Safety Standards and the European Directives according with 
the sectors of activity
A B & C standards: 
European standards for the Safety of machinery form the following structure:
A B1 B2 C
Type A standards
 (Basic safety standards) giving basic concepts, principles for design, and general aspects  
 that can be applied to all machinery;
Type B standards
 (Generic safety standards) dealing with one safety aspect or one type of safeguard that can  
 be used across a wide range of machinery:
 - Type B1 standards on particular safety aspects (e.g. safety distances, surface    
  temperature, noise);
 - Type B2 standards on safeguards (e.g. two-hand controls, interlocking devices, pressure  
  sensitive devices, guards);
Type C standards
 (Machine safety standards) dealing with detailed safety requirements for a particular   
 machine or group of machines.When a Type-C standard deviates from one or more 
provisions dealt with by a Type A standard or by a Type B standard, the Type C standard takes precedence.EN ISO 12100 is Type A standards.

\n14 15Manufacturers’ responsibilities
Manufacturers placing machines on the market within the European Economic Area must 
comply with the requirements of the Machinery Directive. Note that “placing on the market” includes an organisation supplying a machine to itself, i.e. building or modifying machines for its own use, or importing machines into the EEA.
Users’ responsibilities
Users of machines need to ensure that newly-purchased machines are CE marked, and accompanied by a Declaration of Conformity to the Machinery Directive. Machines must be used in accordance with the manufacturer’s instructions.
Existing machines taken into service before the Machinery Directive came into force do not 
need to comply, although they need to comply with the regulations resulting from the Use of Work Equipment Directive and be safe and fit for purpose. 
Modification of machines can be considered as manufacture of a new machine, even if for 
use in-house, and the company modifying a machine needs to be aware that it might need to issue a Declaration of Conformity and CE marking.\n16 17In order for a machine (or other equipment) to be made 
safe it is necessary to assess the risks that can result from its use. Risk assessment and risk reduction are described in EN ISO 12100.
There are various techniques for risk assessment, and none can be said to be “the right way” 
to perform a risk assessment. The standard specifies some general principles but cannot specify exactly what has to be done in every case. It would seem to be nice if the standard could give a value or ‘score’ for each risk, and then a target value for the maximum value that must not be exceeded, but that is not the case for several reasons. The score that would be allocated to each risk, as well as on the level of risk that can be tolerated, depends on a series of judgements, and will vary with the person doing the judging as well as on the environment. For example the risks that might be reasonable in a factory employing skilled workers might be unacceptable in an environment where members of the public, including children, might be present. Historical accident/incident rates can be useful indicators, but cannot give a reliable indication of accident rates that can be expected. 
Risk assesment\n18 19Identify the limits of the machinery
That is, just what is being assessed? What are the speeds/loads/substances etc that 
might be involved? For example how many bottles is the extruder blow moulding per hour, and how much material is being processed at what temperature? Remember to include foreseeable misuse, such as the possible use of a machine outside its specification. What is the expected life of the machinery and its application? How is it likely to be disposed of at the end of its life?
Identify the hazards
What aspects of the machine might cause harm to a person? Consider the possibility of entanglement, crushing, cutting from tools, sharp edges on the machine or on the material being processed. Other factors such as the stability of the machine, noise, vibration, and emission of substances or radiation also need to be considered, as well as burns from hot surfaces, chemicals, or friction due to high speeds. This stage should include all hazards that can be present during the lifecycle of the machinery, including the construction, installation, and disposal.
Examples of typical hazards are illustrated below, though this is not an exhaustive list.A 
more detailed list can be found in EN ISO 12100.
Who might be harmed by the identified hazards, and when?
Who interacts with the machine, when, and why? Again remember foreseeable misuse including the possibility of use of a machine by untrained persons, and persons who might be present in the workplace; not just machine operators, but cleaners, security staff, visitors, and members of the public.Prioritise the risks according to their seriousness
EN ISO 12100 describes this stage as Risk Estimation. This can be done by multiplying the 
potential harm that can come from the hazard by the exposure to the hazard, remembering that there can be more than one person exposed. 
It is difficult to estimate the potential harm, given the possibility that every accident can lead 
to a fatality. However usually when there is more than one possible consequence, one will be more likely than the others. All plausible consequences should be considered, not just the worst case.
The result of the Risk Assessment process should be a table of the various risks that exist 
at the machine, together with an indication of the seriousness of each. There is not a single “risk rating” or “risk category” for a machine – each risk must be considered separately. Note that the seriousness can only be estimated – Risk Assessment is not a precise science. Neither is it an end in itself; the purpose of Risk Assessment is to guide Risk Reduction.

Risk reduction is dealt with EN ISO 12100
Risk reduction is defined in terms of eliminating risk: “the aim of measures taken must be to 
eliminate any risk throughout the foreseeable lifetime of the machinery including the phases of transport, assembly, dismantling, disabling and scrapping.”
In general, if a risk can be reduced then it should be reduced. This has to be tempered by 
commercial realities though, and regulations use words like “reasonable” to indicate that it might not be possible to eliminate some risks without a grossly disproportionate cost.
The process of risk assessment is iterative – risks need to be identified, prioritised, 
quantified, design steps taken to reduce them (first by safe design, then by safeguarding), and then this process is to be repeated to assess whether the individual risks have been reduced to a tolerable level and that no additional risks have be introduced. In the next chapter we examine safe design and safeguarding.

\n22 23Inherently safe design measures  
(as per EN ISO 12100 sub clause 6.2)
Some risks can be avoided by simple measures; can the task that results in the risk be 
eliminated? Elimination can sometimes be achieved by automation of some tasks such as machine loading. Can the hazard be removed? For example, the use of a non-flammable solvent for cleaning tasks can remove the fire hazard associated with flammable solvents. This stage is known as inherently safe design, and is the only way of reducing a risk to zero.
Removing the drive from the end roller of a roller conveyor will reduce the possibility of 
someone being caught up by the roller. Replacing spoked pulleys with smooth discs can reduce shearing hazards. Avoidance of sharp edges, corners and protusions can help to avoid cuts and bruises. Increasing minimum gaps can help to avoid body parts getting crushed, reducing maximum gaps can eliminate the possibility of body parts entering. Reduced forces, speeds and pressures can reduce the risk of injury.

Take care to avoid substituting one hazard for another. For example air-powered tools 
avoid the hazards associated with electricity, but can introduce other hazards from the use of compressed air, such as injection of air into the body and compressor noise.Safe design & safe-
guarding
Standards and 
legislation express a distinct hierarchy for controls. The elimination of hazards or reduction of risks to a tolerable level, by inherently safe design measures is the first priority. \n24 25Safeguarding & complementary protective measures  
(as per EN ISO 12100 sub clause 6.3)
Where inherently safe design is not practicable, the next step is safeguarding. This measure can include, for 
example, fixed guarding, interlocked guarding, presence sensing to prevent unexpected start-up, etc. 
Safeguarding should prevent persons from coming into contact with hazards, or reduce hazards to a safe state, 
before a person can come into contact with them.
Guards themselves can be fixed to enclose or distance a hazard, or movable such that they are either self-closing, 
power-operated or interlocked.
Light curtains to detect approach to dangerous areas 
By finger, hand or body (upto 14mm, upto 30mm and above 30mm resolution) 
Light curtains are typically used in material handling, packaging, conveyor, 
warehousing and other applications. They are designed for the protection of persons operating or working in the vicinity of machinery, by the stopping of dangerous movement of parts as soon as one of the light beams is broken. They make it possible to protect personnel whilst allowing free access to machines. The absence of a door or guard reduces the time taken required for loading, inspection or adjustment operations as well as making access easier.
Safety mats to detect persons  
Approaching, standing in or climbing into the danger area 
Safety foot mats are typically used in front of or around potentially 
dangerous machines or robots. They provide a protection zone between the machine operators and any dangerous movements. They are mainly designed to ensure the safety of personnel, and supplement safety products such as light curtains to enable free access for the loading or unloading of machines. They work by detecting persons stepping onto the mat and instigating the stopping of the dangerous movement.
Typical protective devices used as part of  
safeguarding systems include:
Interlock switches to detect the position of movable guards for control interlocking, usually 
to permit tasks such as loading/unloading, cleaning, setting, adjustment etc. 
Protection of operators is provided by stopping the machine when the actuator is 
withdrawn from the head of the switch, when the lever or plunger is actuated, when the guard is opened or the guard hinge rotates through 5° – generally on machines with low inertia (i.e. quick stopping times)
\n26 27Two hand control stations and footswitches   
Used to ensure the operator is standing away from the danger 
area when causing dangerous movements (e.g. down stroke in press applications) 
They provide protection primarily to the machine operator. 
Supplementary protection to other personnel can be provided through other measures, such as the positioning of light curtains.
Enabling switches to permit access under 
specific conditions of reduced risk   
To areas for fault-finding, commissioning etc (e.g. jogging and 
inching), with a central position and 2 “off” positions (fully released or clenched).
Monitoring of safety signals – control systems
The signals from safeguarding components are typically monitored using safety relays, 
safety controllers or safety PLCs (collectively referred to as “safety logic solvers”), which in turn are used to drive (and sometimes monitor) output devices such as contactors. 
The choice of logic solver will depend upon many factors including the number of safety 
inputs to process, cost, complexity of the safety functions themselves, the need to reduce cabling through decentralisation using a fieldbus such as AS-Interface Safety at Work or SafeEthernet, or even the need to send safety signals/data over long distances across large machines or between machines on large sites. The now common use of complex electronics and software in safety controllers and safety PLCs has, in part, driven the evolution of the standards relating to safety related electrical control systems.Solenoid interlocks to prevent opening of guards   
During dangerous phases of operation. Unlike non-solenoid interlocks, they 
are used on loads with high inertia i.e. where the stopping time is long and it is preferable to permit access only when the dangerous movement has stopped.These are often used with either a time delay circuit (where machine stopping time is defined and known) or actual detection of zero speed (where stopping times can vary) to permit access only when safe conditions are met.
Interlocking devices should be selected and installed with regard to minimising 
the possibility of defeat and failure, and the overall safeguard should not unnecessarily impede production tasks. Steps to achieve this include:
- devices fastened securely in a (fixed) place and requiring a tool to  
remove or adjust;
- coded devices or systems, e.g. mechanically, electrically,  
magnetically or optically;
- physical obstruction or shielding to prevent access to the interlocking device 
when the guard is open;
- the support for devices shall be sufficiently rigid to maintain correct operation
Safeguarding will usually involve the use of some kind of control system, and the Machinery 
Directive gives various requirements for the performance of the control system. In particular it states “Control systems must be designed and constructed in such a way as to prevent hazardous situations from arising”. The Machinery Directive does not specify the use of any particular standard, but the use of a control system meeting the requirements of  harmonised standard(s) is one means of demonstrating compliance with this requirement of the Machinery Directive. Two such standards available at the time of writing are EN ISO 13849-1 (replacing EN 954-1) and EN 62061.Two such standards available at time of writing include EN ISO 13849-1 (replacing EN 954-1) and EN 62061.

\n28 29Complementary protective measures - Emergency stop
Although emergency stops are required for all machines (the Machinery Directive allows 
two very specific exemptions) they are not considered to be a primary means of risk reduction. Instead they are referred to as a “complementary protective measure”. They are provided as a backup for use in an emergency only. They need to be robust, dependable, and available at all positions where it might be necessary to operate them.
EN 60204-1 defines the following three categories of stop functions as follows:– Stop category 0: stopping by immediate removal of power to the machine actuators 
(uncontrolled stop);
– Stop category 1: a controlled stop with power available to the machine actuators to 
achieve the stop and then removal of power when the stop is achieved;
– Stop category 2: a controlled stop with power left available to the machine actuators.However stop category 2 is not usually considered suitable for emergency stops.Emergency stops on machinery must be “trigger action”. This means that their design 
ensures that however slowly the button is pressed, or cable pulled, if the normally-closed contact opens the mechanism must latch. This prevents “teasing”, which can cause dangerous situations. The converse must also be true, i.e. latching must not take place unless the NC contact opens. Emergency stop devices should comply with  EN 60947-5-5.
Residual risks
After risks have been reduced as far as possible by design, and then by safeguarding, 
the risk assessment process should be repeated to check that no new risks have been introduced (e.g. powered guards can introduce trapping hazards) and to estimate whether each risk has been reduced to a tolerable level. Even after some iterations of the risk assessment/risk reduction procedure, it is likely that there will be some residual risks. 
Except for machines built to a specific harmonised standard (C Standard) it is for the 
designer to judge whether the residual risk is tolerable or whether further measures need to be taken, and to provide information about those residual risks, in the form of warning labels, instructions for use, etc. The instructions might also specify measures such as the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) or special working procedures, but these are not as dependable as measures implemented by the designer. \n30 31Functional Safety
The IEC have published a series of FAQs related to Functional Safety at  
http://www.iec.ch/zone/fsafety/
A number of standards have been published in recent years that use the concept of 
functional safety. Examples include IEC 61508, IEC 62061, IEC 61511, ISO 13849-1, and IEC 61800-5-2 which have all been adopted in Europe and published as ENs.
Functional safety is a relatively recent concept that replaces the old ‘Categories’ of 
behaviour under fault conditions that were defined in EN 954-1, and were often mistakenly described as ‘Safety Categories’. 
A reminder of the principles of EN 954-1
Users of EN 954-1 will be familiar with the old “risk graph” which many used to design their safety related parts of electrical control circuits to the categories B, 1, 2, 3 or 4. The user was prompted to subjectively assess severity of injury, frequency of exposure and possibility of avoidance in terms of slight to serious, rare to frequent, and possible to virtually impossible, to arrive at a required category for each safety related part.
The thinking is that the more the risk reduction depends upon the safety-related control 
system* (SRECS), the more it needs to be resistant to faults (such as short circuits, welded contacts etc).
The behaviour of the categories under fault conditions was defined as follows:- Category B control circuits are basic and can lead to a loss of the safety function due to a fault.- Category 1 can also lead to a loss of the safety function, but with less probability than 
category B.
- Category 2 circuits detect faults by periodic testing at suitable intervals (the safety 
function can be lost between the periodic tests)S1

\n32 33Functional safety is “part of the overall safety relating to the EUC* and the EUC control 
system which depends on the correct functioning of the E/E/PE** safety-related systems, other technology safety-related systems and external risk reduction facilities”. Note that it is an attribute of the equipment under control and of the control system, not of any particular component or specific kind of device. It applies to all components that contribute to the performance of a safety function, including for example, input switches, logic solvers such as PLCs and IPCs (including their software and firmware) and output devices such as contactors and variable speed drives. 
* EUC means Equipment Under Control
**Note  E/E/PE means Electrical/Electronic/Programmable Electronic. 
It should also be remembered that the words “correct functioning” mean that the function 
is correct, not just what was expected, which means the functions have to be selected correctly. In the past there has been a tendency for components specified to a high category of EN 954-1 to be chosen instead of components that have a lower category, but might actually have more suitable functions. This might be as a result of the misconception that the categories are hierarchical such that for example, category 3 is always “better” than category 2 and so on.  Functional safety standards are intended to encourage designers to focus more on the functions that are necessary to reduce each individual risk, and what performance is required for each function, rather than simply relying on particular components.- Category 3 circuits  ensure the safety function, in the presence of a single fault, for example by employing two (redundant) channels, but a loss of the safety function can occur in the case of an accumulation of faults

\n34 35Which standards are applicable to the safety function?
Now that EN 954-1 is withdrawn, the available alternatives are EN 62061 and EN ISO 
13849-1.
The performance of each safety function is specified as either a SIL (Safety Integrity Level) 
in the case of EN 62061 or PL (Performance Level) in the case of EN ISO 13849-1.
In both cases the architecture of the control circuit which delivers the safety function is a 
factor, but unlike EN 954-1 these new standards require consideration of the reliability of the selected components.
EN 62061
It is important to consider each function in detail; EN 62061 requires a Safety Requirements Specification (SRS) to be drawn up. This includes a functional specification (what it does, in detail) and a safety integrity specification, which defines the required probability that the function will be performed under the specified conditions.
An example often used is “stop the machine when the guard is open”, which really needs 
more detailed consideration, initially of the functional specification. For example, will the machine be stopped by removing the coil voltage from a contactor, or by ramping-down the speed using a variable speed drive? Is it necessary to lock the guard closed until the dangerous movements have stopped? Will other equipment, upstream or downstream, need to be shut down? How will the opening of the guard be detected? 
The safety integrity specification must consider both random hardware failures and 
systematic failures. Systematic failures are those which are related to a specific cause, and can only be avoided by removal of that cause, usually by a modification of the design. In practice, most ‘real-world’ failures are systematic and result from incorrect specification.
As part of the normal design processes, this specification should lead to the selection of 
suitable design measures; for example, heavy and misaligned guards can lead to damaged interlock switches unless shock absorbers and alignment pins are fitted, contactors should be suitably rated and protected against overloads.
How often will the guard be opened? What might be the consequences of a failure of the 
function? What will the ambient conditions (temperature, vibration, humidity, etc) be?
In EN 62061, a safety integrity requirement is expressed as a target failure value for the 
probability of dangerous failure per hour of each Safety related control function (SRCF). This can be calculated from reliability data for each component or sub-system, and is related to the SIL as shown in Table 3 of the standard:EN ISO 13849-1 
EN ISO 13849-1 uses a combination of the Mean Time To Dangerous Failure (MTTFd), 
Diagnostic Coverage (DC) and architecture (category) to determine Performance Level PL 
(a, b, c, d, e), and a simplified method of estimating PL is given in Table 7 of the standard. The categories are the same as those in EN 954-1, which are explained in Annex 2.

From the table above it can be seen that only a category 4 architecture can be used 
to achieve the highest PLe, but that is possible to achieve lower PLs using categories depending upon the mix of MTTF

For the estimation of MTTFd of a component the following data can be used, in order of

2. Methods in Annexes C and D of EN ISO 13849-13. Choose 10 years

Table 4: Diagnostic Coverage levels
Common Cause Failures (CCF) occur when an external effect (such as physical damage) 
renders a number of components unusable irrespective of MTTFd. Steps taken to reduce CCF include:
- Diversity in the components used and modes in which they are driven- Protection against pollution- Separation- Improved electromagnetic compatibilityWhich standard to use?
Unless a C-standard specifies a target SIL or PL, the designer is free to choose whether to 
use EN 62061 or EN ISO 13849-1, or indeed any other standard. Both  EN 62061 and EN ISO 13849-1 are harmonised standards that give a Presumption of Conformity to the Essential Requirements of the Machinery Directive, in so far as they apply. However it should be remembered that whichever standard is chosen must be used in its entirety, and they cannot be mixed in a single system.
Work is ongoing in a liaison group between IEC and ISO, In the meantime a guidance 
document has been published by IEC as IEC 62061-1, and by ISO as ISO 23849-1, with the title “Guidance on the application of ISO 13849-1 and IEC 62061 in the design of safety-related control systems for machinery” with the aim of eventually producing a single standard.
EN 62061 is perhaps more comprehensive on the subjects of specification and 
management responsibilities, whereas EN ISO 13849-1 is designed to allow an easier transition from EN 954-1.
Certification
Some component products are available with certification to a specific SIL or PL. It should be remembered that these certificates are only an indication of the best SIL or PL that can be achieved by a system using that component in a specific configuration, and are not a guarantee that a completed system will meet any specific SIL or PL.Index MTTFd range
Index Diagnostic coverageDiagnostic coverage is a measure of how many dangerous failures the diagnostic system 
will detect. The level of safety can be increased where sub-systems are tested internally using self-diagnostics.
\n38 39Perhaps the best way to understand the application of 
EN 62061 and EN ISO 13849-1 is by way of the worked examples on the following pages.
For both standards we will use the example where the opening of a 
guard must cause the moving parts of a machine to stop, where if it did not stop the resulting possible injury could be a broken arm or amputated finger.
Control system 
standards worked examples\n40 41Safety-related electrical control systems in machines (SRECS) are playing an increasing role 
in ensuring the overall safety of machines and are more and more frequently using complex electronic technology. This standard is specific to the machine sector within the framework of EN 61508.
It gives rules for the integration of sub-systems designed in accordance with  
EN ISO 13849-1. It does not specify the operating requirements of non-electrical control components in machines (for example: hydraulic, pneumatic).
Functional approach to safety
The process starts with analysis of the risks (EN ISO 12100) in order to be able to determine the safety requirements. A particular feature of EN 62061 is that it prompts the user to make an analysis of the architecture to perform the safety functions, then consider sub-functions and analyse their interactions before deciding on a hardware solution for the safety control system, called safety related electrical control system (SRECS).
A functional safety plan must be drawn up and documented for each design 
project. It must include:
A specification of the safety requirements for the safety functions (SRCF) that is in two 
parts:
- A description of the functions and interfaces, operating modes, function priorities,  
frequency of operation, etc.
- Specification of the safety integrity requirements for each function, expressed in terms   
of SIL (Safety Integrity Level).
- Table 1 below gives the target maximum failure values for each SIL.Worked example using standard 
EN 62061

- The structured and documented design process for electrical control systems (SRECS),
- The procedures and resources for recording and maintaining appropriate information,- The process for management and modification of the configuration, taking into account 
organisation and authorised personnel,
- The verification and validation plan.The advantage of this approach is that it can offer a calculation method that incorporates 
all the parameters that can affect the reliability of control systems. The method consists of assigning a SIL to each function, taking into account the following parameters:
- The probability of a dangerous failure of the components (PFH
D),
- The type of architecture (A, B, C or D), i.e.; 
 With or without redundancy, 
 With or without diagnostic features making it possible to control some of the   
 dangerous failures,
- Common cause failures (CCF), including; Short-circuits between channels, 
 Overvoltage, 
 Loss of power supply, etc.,
- The probability of dangerous transmission errors where digital communication is used,
- Electromagnetic interference (EMI).
Designing a system is split into 5 steps after having drawn up the functional safety plan:
1. Based on the risk assessment, assign a safety integrity level (SIL) and identify the basic 
structure of the electrical control system (SRECS), describe each related function (SRCF),
2. Break down each function into a function block structure (FB),3. List the safety requirements for each function block and assign the function blocks to 
the sub-systems within the architecture,
4. Select the components for each sub-system,5. Design the diagnostic function and check that the specified safety integrity level (SIL) is 
achieved.
In our example, consider a function which removes the power to a motor when a guard 
is opened. If the function fails, it would be possible for the machine operator’s arm to be broken or a finger amputated. Safety of Machinery - Functional Safety of safety-related electrical,

42 43Step 1 - Assign a safety integrity level (SIL) and identify the 
structure of the SRECS
Based on the risk assessment performed in accordance with EN ISO 12100, estimation of 
the required SIL is performed for each safety-related control function (SRCF) and is broken down into parameters, as shown in the illustration below. 
Severity of 
the possible
harm
SeSeverity Se
The severity of injuries or damage to health can be estimated by taking into account 
reversible injuries, irreversible injuries or death.
The recommended classification is shown in the table below.
Irreversible: death, losing an eye or arm 4
Irreversible: broken limb(s),  losing a finger(s) 3
Reversible: requiring attention from a  
medical practitioner 2
Reversible: requiring first aid 1
Probability of the harm occurring
Each of the three parameters Fr, Pr, Av is estimated separately using the least favourable 
case. It is recommended that a task analysis is used in order to ensure that estimation of the probability of the harm occurring is correctly taken into account.
Frequency and duration of exposure Fr
The level of exposure is linked to the need to access the hazardous zone (normal operation, maintenance, ...) and the type of access (manual feeding, adjustment, ...). It is then possible to estimate the average frequency and duration of exposure.
The recommended classification is shown in the table below:
< 1 h 5

\n44 45Probability of occurrence of a hazardous event Pr
Two basic concepts must be taken into account:
the predictability of the dangerous components in the various parts of the machine in 
its various operating modes (normal, maintenance, troubleshooting), paying particular attention to unexpected restarting;
behaviour of the persons interacting with the machine, such as stress, fatigue, 
inexperience, etc.
Very high 5
Likely 4
Possible 3
Rarely 2
Negligible 1
Probability of avoiding or limiting the harm Av
This parameter is linked to the design of the machine. It takes into account the suddenness 
of the occurrence of the hazardous event, the nature of the hazard (cutting, temperature, electrical), the possibility of physically avoiding the hazard, and the possibility for a person to identify a hazardous phenomenon.
Impossible 5
Rarely 3
Probable 1SIL assignment:
Estimation is made with the help of the table below.
In our example, the degree of severity (Se) is 3 because there is a risk of a finger being 
amputated; this value is shown in the first column of the table. All the other parameters must be added together in order to select one of the classes (vertical columns in the table below), which gives:
Fr = 5 accessed several times a day
Pr = 4 hazardous event probableAv = 3 probability of avoiding almost impossible
Therefore a class CI = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12
The safety-related electrical control system (SRECS) of the machine must perform this 
function with an integrity level of SIL 2.

Basic structure of the SRECS
Before going into detail about the hardware components to be used, the system is broken 
down into sub-systems. In this example, 3 sub-systems are necessary to perform the input, processing and output functions. The figure opposite illustrates this stage, using the terminology given in the standard.

\n46 47Step 2 - Break down each function into a function block structure (FB)
A function block (FB) is the result of a detailed break down of a safety-related function.
The function block structure gives an initial concept of the SRECS architecture. The safety 
requirements of each block are derived from the safety requirements specification of the corresponding safety-related control function.

Step 3 - List the safety requirements for each function block 
and assign the function blocks to the sub-systems within the architecture.
Each function block is assigned to a sub-system in the SRECS architecture. (The standard 
defines ‘subsystem’ in such a way that failure of any sub-system will lead to the failure of a safety-related control function.) More than one function block may be assigned to each sub-system.  Each sub-system may include sub-system elements and, if necessary, diagnostic functions in order to ensure that failures can be detected and the appropriate action taken.
These diagnostic functions are considered as separate functions; they may be performed 
within the sub-system, or by another sub-system. The sub-systems must achieve at least the same SIL capability as assigned to the entire safety-related control function, each with its own SIL Claim Limit (SILCL). In this case the SILCL of each subsystem must be 2.

The reliability data is obtained from the manufacturer.
The cycle length in this example is 450 seconds, so the duty cycle C is 8 operations per hour, 
i.e. the guard will be opened 8 times per hour. 
\n48 49Step 5 - Design the diagnostic function
The SIL achieved by the sub-systems depends not only on the components, but also 
on the architecture selected. For this example, we will choose architectures B for the contactor outputs and D for the limit switch (See Annex 1 of this Guide for explanation of architectures A, B, C and D).
In this architecture, the safety logic module performs self-diagnostics, and also checks the 
safety limit switches. There are three sub-systems for which the SILCLs (SIL Claim Limits) must be determined:
SS1: two safety limit switches in a sub-system with a type D (redundant) architecture;
SS2: a SILCL 3 safety logic module (determined from the data, including PFH
D, provided 
by the manufacturer);SS3: two contactors used in accordance with a type B (redundant with no feedback) architecture
The calculation takes into account the following parameters:B10: number of operations at which 10% of the population will have failed.
C: Duty cycle (number of operations per hour).
lD: rate of dangerous failures ( l = x proportion of dangerous failures).
b: common cause failure factor: see Annex F of the standard.
T1: Proof Test Interval or life time, whichever is smaller, as specified by the manufacturer. The standard states that designers should use a lifetime of 20 years, to avoid the use of an unrealistically short proof test interval being use to improve the SIL calculation. However it recognises that electromechanical components can need replacement when their specified number of operations is reached. Therefore the figure used for T1 can be the manufacturer’s quoted lifetime, or in the case of electromechanical components the B10
D 
value divided by the rate of operations C.
T2: diagnostic test interval.
DC: Diagnostic coverage rate = lDD / lDtotal, the ratio between the rate of detected 
dangerous failures and the rate of total dangerous failures.Guard Sensing

\n50 51Looking at the output contactors in subsystem SS3 we need to calculate the PFHD. For the
type B architecture
(single fault tolerant, without diagnostics) the probability of dangerous failure of the subsystem is:l
DssB =(1 – b)2 x lDe1 x lDe2 x T1 + b x (lDe1 + lDe2 )/2
[Equation B of the standard]PFH
DssB = lDssB x 1h
In this example, b = 0.1l
De1 = lDe2 = 0.73 (0.1 X C / 1 000 000) = 0.73(0.8/1 000 000) = 5.84 x 10-7
T1 = min (life time, B10/C) = min (175 200, 1 000 000/8) = min (175 200, 125 000)
= 125 000 hoursl
DssB = (1 – 0.1)2 x 5.84 x 10-7 x 5.84 x 10-7 x 125 000 + 0.1 x ((5.84 x 10-7) +
(5.84 x 10-7 ))/2
= 0.81 x 5.84 x 10-7 x 5.84 x 10-7 x 125 000 + 0.1 x 5.84 x 10-7
= 0.81x 3.41056 x 10-13 x 125000 + 0.1 x 5.84 x 10-7
= (3.453 x 10-8) + (5.84 x 10-8) = 9.29 x 10-8
Since PFHDssB = lDss x 1h, PFHD for the contactors in Subsystem SS3 = 9.29 x 10-8
This is within the limits of SILCL 2 and SILCL 3. However, Table 5 of EN 62061 placesarchitectural constraints upon achieving a particular SIL claim limit, and in the case of architecture B where the safe failure fraction is lessthan 60% (the safe failure fraction is 27% for contactors) and the hardware fault tolerance is 1, the stated maximumSIL claim limit that can be achieved is actually SILCL 1. This means that the overall SIL of this system can not be greater than 1. In order to achieve greater than SILCL 1 for the contactors, they need additional diagnostic coverage, and in the case of Schneider Electric contactors this can be achieved by wiring the mirror contacts (n/c auxiliaries) back into the safety relay “external device monitoring” input (EDM), thus achieving a type D architecture with a SFF of >99% and a SILCL of 3 (calculation follows).Note: the wiring of the contactors back into the safety relay also changes the Safe Failure 
Fraction of the contactor subsystem from less than 60% to greater than 99% (a dangerous failure of one of the contactors will prevent a restart), thus, referring to table 5 it becomes possible to achieve up to SIL CL 3.l
DssD = (1 – 0.1)2 {[5.84 x 10-7 x 5.84 x 10-7 x 2 x 0.99] 0.125 /2 + [5.84 x 10-7 x 5.84 x 10-7

= (3.883 x 10-14) + (8.44 x 10-9) + (5.84 x 10-8)
= 6.684 x 10-8
Since PFHDssD = lDssD x 1h, the PFHDssD for the contactor subsystem
in architecture B is 6.684 x 10-8.
This means the subsystem has a SILCL of 3

T2 = 1/C = 1/8 = 0.125 hour
From D.2; for Subsystem elements of the same design:l
DssD = (1 – 0.1)2 {[ 1.6 x 10-8 x 1.6 x 10-8 x 2 x 0.99 ] x 0.125 /2 + [1.6 x 10-8 x 1.6 x 10-8 x
(1 – 0.99) ] x 87 600}   + 0.1 x 1.6 x 10-8
= 2.56 x 10-17 + 2.24 x 10-13 + 1.6 x 10-9
= 1.6 x 10-9
Since PFHDssD = lDssD x 1h, PFHD for the limit switches in Subsystem SS1 = 1.63 x 10-9
We already know that for Subsystem SS2, PFHD for the logic solver Function Block 
(implemented by the safety relay XPSAK) is 7.389 x 10-9 (manufacturer’s data)
The overall PFHD for the safety related electrical control system (SRECS) is the sum of the 
PFHDs for all the Function Blocks, and is therefore: 
PFHDSRECS = PFHDSS1 + PFHDSS2 + PFHDSS3 = 
1.6 x 10-9 + 7.39 x 10-9 + 6.68 x 10-8 = 7.58 x 10-8
All of the subsystems have SIL claim limits within SILCL 3, and the calculationabove results in an overall SIL for the system within the limits of SIL 3.

STEP 1: Risk Assessment and identification of the necessary safety functions.STEP 2: Determine the required Performance Level (PLr) for each safety function.STEP 3: Identify the combination of safety-related parts which carry out the safety function.STEP 4: Evaluate the Performance Level PL for the all safety-related parts.STEP 5: Verify that the PL of the SRP/CS* for the safety function is at least equal to the PLr.STEP 6: Validate that all requirements are met (see EN ISO 13849-2).
*Safety related part of control system (name of safety machine control system in EN ISO 13849-1 standard).
For more detail please refer to Annex 2 of this Guide.
STEP 1: As in the previous example, we need a safety function to remove the power 
supply to the motor when the guard is open.
STEP 2: Using the “risk graph” from Figure A.1 of EN ISO 13849-1, and the same 
parameters as in the previous example, the required Performance Level is d  (note: PL d is often compared to SIL 2 as “equivalent”).

STEP 4: The PL of the SRP/CS is determined by estimation of the following parameters: 
(see Annex 2):
- The CATEGORY (structure) (see Clause 6 of EN ISO 13849-1). Note that in this example 
the use of a category 3 architecture means that the mirror contacts on the contactors are not used.
- The MTTF
d for the single components (see Annexes C & D of EN ISO 13849-1)
- The Diagnostic Coverage (see Annex E of EN ISO 13849-1)- The Common Cause Failures (see score table in Annex F of EN ISO 13849-1) 
The manufacturer gives the following data for the components:
Example SRP/CS B10 (operations) MTTFd (years) DC
Safety limit 
switches10 000 000 99%
Safety logic module XPSAK154.5 99%
Contactors 1 000 000 0%
Note that because the manufacturer does not know the application details, and specifically 
the cycle rate of the electromechanical devices, he can only give B10 or B10d data for the 
electromechanical components. This explains why no manufacturer should provide an MTTF
d figure for an electromechanical device.
\n54 55The MTTFd  for components can be determined from the formula:
MTTFd = B10d / (0.1 x nop)
Where nop is the mean annual number of operations.
B10 is number of operations at which 10% of the population will have failed. 
B10d is the expected time at which 10% of the population will have failed in a “dangerous” mode. Without specific knowledge of which mode in which a component is being used, and hence what constitutes a dangerous failure, for a limit switch the % of dangerous failure is 20%, therefore B10
d = B10/20% 
Assuming the machine is used for 8 hours a day, for 220 days per year, with a cycle time of 120 seconds, n
op will be 52800 operations per year.
Assuming that B10d = B10/20%, the table becomes:

The MTTFd figures in bold red have been derived from the application data using the cycle 
rates and B10d data.
The MTTFd can be calculated for each channel by using the parts count method in 
Annex D of the standard. 
SW1
MTTFd = 9469y
SW2
MTTFd = 9469yXPS
MTTFd = 
154.5yCON1
MTTFd = 259y
CON2
MTTFd = 259yChannel 1
Channel 2
In this example the calculation is identical for channels 1 and 2:
The MTTFd for each channel is therefore 95 years; this is “high” according to Table 3
From the equations in Annex E of the standard we can determine that DCavg = 62.4% ; this 
is “low” according to Table 41 1 1 1 1
MTTFd 9469 years 154.5 years 259 years 95.85 years= = + +STEP 5: Verify that the PL of the system matches the required PL (PLr)
Knowing that we have a category 3 architecture, a high MTTFd and a low average 
Diagnostic Coverage (DCavg), it can be seen from the table below (fig. 5 of the standard) that 
we have met PL d, which meets the required PL d.Just as in the EN 62061 worked example, it only takes the wiring of both contactors’ 
normally closed auxiliary mirror contacts back to the external device monitoring input of the safety relay to change the architecture to category 4. Doing this converts DCavg to 99% ; this is “high” according to Table 4
Knowing that we have a category 4 architecture, a high MTTF
d and a high average 
Diagnostic Coverage (DCavg), referring to Table 7 of the standard shows that the resulting 
Performance Level is PL e, which matches the PL r.
STEP 6: Validation – check working and where necessary test (EN ISO 13849-2).Cat. B Cat. 1 Cat. 2 Cat. 2 Cat. 3 Cat. 3 Cat. 4

Annex 2
Categories of EN ISO 13849-1
Category     Description             Example
Category BWhen a fault occurs it can lead to the loss of the safety 
function
Category 1When a fault occurs it can lead to the loss of the safety function, but the MTTF
d of each channel in Category 1 is 
higher than in Category B. Consequently the loss of the safety function is less likely.
Category 2Category 2 system behaviour allows that: the occurrence of a fault can lead to the loss of the safety function between the checks; the loss of the safety function is detected by the check.
Category 3SRP/CS to Category 3 shall be designed so that a single fault in any of these safety-related parts does not lead to the loss of the safety function. Whenever reasonably possible the single fault shall be detected at or before the next demand upon the safety function
Category 4SRP/CS to Category 4 shall be designed so that a single fault in any of these safety-related parts does not lead to the loss of the safety function, and the single fault is detected on or before the next demand upon the safety functions, e.g. immediately, at switch on, at end of a machine operation cycle. If this detection is not possible an accumulation of undetected faults shall not lead to the loss of the safety function.Output Input Logicimim
