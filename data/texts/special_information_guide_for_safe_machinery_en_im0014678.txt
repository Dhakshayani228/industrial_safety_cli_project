Figure 1: Machine safety inspection
Safe machines increase legal certainty for the manufacturer and user. Machine operators expect to be offered
only s
afe machinery or devices. This expectation exists worldwide. There are also regulations on the protection of
operators of machinery worldwide. Such regulations are different depending on countries and regions. However,
there is broad agreement on the process to be applied during the manufacture and upgrade of machinery:
During the design and manufacture of machinery, the machine manufacturer shall identify and evaluate all
possible hazards and hazardous points by undertaking a risk assessment.
Based on this risk assessment, the machine manufacturer shall take suitable design measures to eliminate or
reduce the risk. If the risk cannot be eliminated by these design measures or the remaining risk is not tolerable,
the machine manufacturer shall select and apply suitable protective devices, and provide information on the
residual risks if necessary.
To ensure the intended measures work correctly, overall validation is necessary. This overall validation shall
evaluate the design and technical measures, as well as the organizational measures in context.
About this guide
What does the guide contain?
You ha
ve before you a comprehensive guide on machine safety requirements and on the selection and use of
protective devices. We will show you various ways in which you can safeguard machinery and protect persons
against accidents taking into account the applicable European directives, regulations, and standards. The exam‐
ples and statements given are the result of our many years of practical experience and are to be considered
typical applications.FOREWORD

Subject to change without notice\nFor better orientation and guidance through the guide,
we ha
ve divided the path to a safe machine into 6 main
steps. Two additional chapters describe the regulatory
requirements for the machine manufacturer and the
requirements for the machine user.
This guide describes the legal requirements on the
safety of machinery in the European Union and their
implementation. The legal requirements relating to
machinery in other regions (e.g., North America, Asia)
are described in separate versions of this guide.
It is not possible to derive any claims whatsoever from
the following information, irrespective of the legal basis,
as every machine requires a specific solution against
the background of national and international regula‐
tions and standards.
We refer to the latest published standards and direc‐
tives at the time of publishing. If, in the event of new
standards, the use of the predecessor standard is per‐
mitted for a transition period, we have noted this situa‐
tion in the relevant chapters of this guide.

Who is this guide for?
This guide is aimed a
t manufacturers, users, designers, system engineers, and all individuals who are responsible
for machine safety.
Use of the terms “safety” and “safe” in this document
Ac
cording to ISO Guide 51, "The term “safe” is often understood by the general public as the state of being
protected from all hazards. However, this is a misunderstanding: “safe” is rather the state of being protected from
recognized hazards that are likely to cause harm”.
Some level of risk is inherent in all products or systems (so-called residual risk). Absolute certainty is therefore not
possible.
In this guide, the terms “safety” and “safe” are used as qualifiers for better understanding and readability. The
terms are defined, as in ISO Guide 51, as “freedom from unacceptable risks” and are not to be understood as
absolute protection against hazards.
SICK assumes no liability for the interpretation of the terms “safe” and “safety” in this document.FOREWORD

Machine safeguarding in the work process
The requirements on the safeguarding of machinery have changed more and more with the increasing use of
automa
tion. In the past, protective devices in the manufacturing process were something of a nuisance; for this
reason, they were often not used at all.
Today, innovative technologies make it easy to integrate protective devices into the manufacturing process. As a
result, they are no longer a hindrance for the operator and even help productivity in many cases.
For this reason, reliable protective devices that are integrated into the manufacturing process are indispensable.FOREWORD

Subject to change without notice\nFigure 4: Development of a safety concept
Safety is a basic need
Safety is a basic human need. Studies show that people continuously subjected to stressful situations are more
suscept ible t
o psychosomatic illnesses. Even though it is possible to adapt to extreme situations over the long
term, they will place a great strain on the individual.
It is often said, however, that more “safety” results in lower productivity – the opposite is actually the case: Higher
levels of safety result in increased motivation and satisfaction and, as a result, higher productivity.
The following requirement on the machine manufacturer and user can be derived from this: Operators and
maintenance personnel shall be able to rely on the safety of a machine!
Safety is a management task
Employers in industry are responsible for their employees as well as for smooth, cost-effective production. Only if
mana g
ers make safety part of everyday business activities will employees be receptive to the subject.
To improve sustainability, experts are therefore calling for the establishment of a wide-ranging “safety culture” in
the respective companies.
Involvement of the employees results in acceptance
It is extremely important that the needs of operators and maintenance personnel are taken into consideration in
the plannin
g at concept level. Only an intelligent safety concept matched to the work process and the personnel
will result in the required acceptance.FOREWORD

Subject to change without notice\nExpert knowledge is required
In the European Union, national legal requirements are harmonized by European legislation such as the Machinery
Direc
tive. Directives describe general requirements that are specified in more detail by standards.
The safety of machinery depends to a large extent on the correct application of such standards. European
standards are often also accepted outside the European Union.
Implementing all these requirements in practice requires extensive specialist knowledge, application expertise,
and many years of experience.FOREWORD

European directives
One of the goals of the European Community is the protection of the health of its citizens both in the private
and in t he pr
ofessional sphere. A further goal is the creation of a single market with free movement of goods.
In order to achieve such goals, the functioning of the European Union is regulated by treaty as follows: The EU
Commission or the Council of the European Union issues legal acts, including so-called directives, which define
the basic objectives and requirements. The directives are kept technology-neutral as far as possible. The Member
States then have to implement these directives in their national legislation.
The following directives have been published in the area of health and safety at work and machine safety:
• The Machinery Directive, which addresses the manufacturers of machines
• The Work Equipment Directive, which addresses the users of machines
• Additional directives, e.g., Low Voltage Directive, EMC Directive, ATEX Directive
The application of harmonized standards provides presumption of 
conformity with the directives.

NOTE
Europe
an directives apply to manufacturers and organizations that place machinery on the market in the Euro‐
pean Union.
The Machinery Directive
Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC addresses the manufacturers and distributors of machines and safety compo‐
nent s
. It establishes the necessary tasks for new machines to meet health and safety requirements in order to
dismantle trade barriers within Europe and to guarantee a high level of health and safety for users and operators.
It applies to machines and to safety components individually placed on the markets, as well as to used machines
and safety components from third-party countries which are placed on the market in the European Economic Area
for the first time (e.g., from the USA or Japan).
• In 1989, the Council of the European Community passed the directive on the approximation of the laws of the
Member States relating to machinery, known as the Machinery Directive (89/392/EEC).
• By 1995, this directive had to be applied in all EC Member States.
• In 1998, various amendments were summarized and consolidated in the Machinery Directive 98/37/EC.
• in 2006, the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC, which replaced the previous version, was passed. All EC
member states were obliged to adopt the new directive by December 29, 2009.
NOTE
As of D
ecember 29, 2009 only Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC is to be implemented!
NOTE
The Mac
hinery Directive was implemented in the German-speaking countries as follows:
• Germany: Ninth Ordinance (Machinery Ordinance / 9. ProdSV) to the Product Safety Act (ProdSG) dated
November 8, 2011
• Switzerland: Federal law on product safety (PrSG) dated June 12, 2009 and Ordinance on the safety of
machinery (Machinery Ordinance) dated April 2, 2008
• Austria: Federal act on protection against dangerous products (Product Safety Act 2004 [PSG 2004]) and
Machine safety ordinance 2010
If machinery and safety components comply with the Machinery Directive, member states may not prohibit, restrict
or im pede t
heir being placed on the market and put into service. It is also forbidden for them to apply national
laws, ordinances, or standards to impose more stringent requirements!
The Work Equipment Directive
The obligations for employers are set out in the Work Equipment Directive, which applies to the use of machinery
and equipment in t
he workplace. The directive contains minimum requirements that must be met when using
work equipment in order to improve occupational health and safety. Each member state may add its own national
requirements: e.g., regarding equipment testing, service and maintenance intervals, the use of personal protective
equipment, or the layout of the workplace. The requirements of the Work Equipment Directive as well as national
requirements and operating regulations are in turn implemented in national laws.§ – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS

Obligations of the machine manufacturer
Safe design of machinery
Manuf ac
turers are obliged to design and build their machines such they are compliant with the essential safety
and health requirements of the Machinery Directive. Manufacturers shall take account of the safety integration
already during the design phase. In practice, this means that the designer shall perform a risk assessment already
at the design phase of the machine. The resulting measures shall be incorporated directly into development. Steps
1 to 5 of this guide describe in detail how to proceed here.
Preparing technical documents
The mac
hine manufacturer shall prepare a technical files according to Annex VII of the Machinery Directive. The
technical files are subject to the following criteria:§ – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS
8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK S P E C I A L  I N F O R M A T I O N  | Guide for Safe Machinery 13
Subject to change without notice\n• It shall cont ain all dia grams, calculations, test reports and documents that are relevant to the conformity with
the essential health and safety requirements of the Machinery Directive.
• It shall be archived for at least ten years from the last day of manufacture of the machine (or the machine
type).
• Shall be submitted to the authorities on duly reasoned request.
NOTE
It is no t pos
sible to derive from the Machinery Directive an obligation on the manufacturer to supply the complete
technical documentation to the purchaser (user) of the machine.
Issuing the declaration of conformity
Aft
er the machine manufacturer has built his machine according to the requirements of the Machinery Directive,
he shall declare, in a legally binding manner, conformity with these requirements by issuing a declaration of
conformity and marking the machine (CE marking). It is then permitted to place the machine on the market in the
European Union.
The Machinery Directive explains the process for the conformity assessment. There are two procedures for
machinery ( see "EU conformity assessment procedure for machinery and safety components", page 16 ):
• Stand ard procedure:
Machines that are not explicitly listed in Annex
IV of the Machinery Directive are subject to
the standard process. The “Essential health and
safety requirements” described in Annex I must
be met. The manufacturer shall then compile the
technical files and apply the CE marking. This
process does not require the involvement of a
third party (test body or authority). The technical
files shall be provided to the national market
authorities upon duly reasoned request.
Figure 7: Safeguarding of a machine and diagnostics on the
pro
tective device
• Procedur e for machinery that is listed in Annex IV:
Machines that are particularly hazardous are subject to special procedures. Annex IV of the Machinery
Directive contains a list of particularly hazardous machinery and also safety components; this list includes
electro-sensitive protective equipment such as photoelectric safety switches and safety laser scanners. The
“Essential health and safety requirements” in Annex I of the Machinery Directive must be met first.
If applicable harmonized standards covering all relevant health and safety requirements are available for the
machiner
y or safety components, the declaration of conformity can then be obtained in one of the following
three ways:
°Self-certification by the standard procedure
°EC type examination by a notified body: A notified body tests whether the machine meets the relevant
essential health and safety requirements applicable to the machinery or the safety component. On com‐
pliance with those requirements, the notified body issues an EC type examination certificate containing
the results of the tests.
°Use of a full quality management system that has been assessed (QMS): The full QMS shall ensure
conformity with the requirements of the Machinery Directive and be assessed by a notified body. The
manufacturer is responsible for the effective and appropriate use of the QMS. See also Annex X of the
Machinery Directive.
If no applicable harmonized standards exist for the machinery or parts of the machinery or if harmonized
st
andards have not been applied, conformity can only be achieved as follows:
°EC type examination by a notified body
°Use of a full quality management system (QMS) that has been assessed§ – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS

Subject to change without notice\nMarking of the machine as conforming to the European directives (“CE conform”)
Once all t he r
equirements have been met and before the machine within the scope of the Machinery Directive is
placed on the market, the CE marking shall be applied to the machine.
NOTE
The CE mar
king can only be affixed if the machine meets all applicable European directives. Only a machine with
the CE marking is allowed to be placed on the market in the European Union.
Special case: Partly completed machinery
In many cases, parts of machines, machine assemblies, or machine components are manufactured and delivered
tha
t are very close to the definition of a machine but cannot be considered complete machines in the context
of the Machinery Directive. The Machinery Directive defines as “partly completed machinery” an assembly of
components that almost form a machine, but that on their own cannot perform any specific function. An individual
industrial robot, for example, is a partly completed machine. A partly completed machine is only intended to be
installed in other machinery or in other partly completed machinery or equipment, or to be combined with such
machinery or equipment in order to form a machine in the context of the Directive.
Partly completed machinery cannot meet all requirements of the Machinery Directive. Therefore, the Machinery
Directive regulates their free trade using a special procedure:
• The manufacturer shall meet all reasonably achievable essential health and safety requirements of the
Machinery Directive.
• The manufacturer shall issue a declaration of incorporation. It describes which essential requirements of the
Machinery Directive are applied and met. Technical documentation, similar to that for a machine, is to be
prepared as appropriate and archived.
• Instead of operating instructions, the manufacture shall prepare assembly instructions in the same manner
and supply them with every “partly completed” machine. The language used in these assembly instructions
can be agreed between the manufacturer and user (integrator).

• You shall take account of safety integration during the design process.
• For the declaration of conformity, you shall use either the standard procedure or the procedure for machinery
in Annex IV of the Machinery Directive.
• You shall compile a technical documentation file for the machine; in particular, this shall include all safety-
related design documents.
• You shall supply operating instructions with the product in an official language of the country of use. If these
operating instructions are not “original operating instructions” in an official EU language, then such a version
must also be supplied.
• You shall issue a declaration of conformity and mark the machine or the safety component with the CE
marking.
As a machine user, the Work Equipment Directive applies to you:
• Obser
ve the requirements of the Work Equipment Directive and its national implementations. These may also
include more stringent requirements!
• You shall find out whether further national requirements (e.g., testing of work equipment, service or mainte‐
nance intervals, etc.) exist and comply with them.
Standards
Standards are technical agreements made between the various interested parties (manufacturers, users, test
bodie s
, occupational health and safety authorities, and governments). Contrary to popular opinion, standards are
not prepared or agreed by governments or authorities. Standards describe the state-of-the-art at the time they are
drafted. Over the last 100 years, a change from national standards to globally applicable standards has taken§ – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS

make it nec
essary to apply different standards. The correct selection and application of standards supports the
machine manufacturer to ensure compliance with legal requirements.
This guide makes reference to international standards (ISO, IEC). An overview of the relevant standards is provided
in the annex, page 166 .
The overview also contains their regional equivalents (e.g. EN) or equivalent national standards to the referenced
international standards.
Global standardization organizations and structures
ISO (International Standardization Organization)
ISO is a w
orldwide network of standardization organizations from 165 countries. ISO
prepares and publishes international standards focused on non-electrical technolo‐
gies.
IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission)
The Int
ernational Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is a global organization that pre‐
pares and publishes international standards in the area of electrical technology (e.g.,
electronics, communications, electromagnetic compatibility, power generation), and
related technologies.
Types of standards
There are three types of standards:
Type-A
Type
-A standards, also called basic safety standards, contain basic terminology, principles of design and general
aspects that can be applied to all machinery.
Type-B
Type
-B standards, also called generic safety standards, address a safety aspect or protective device that can be
used for a wide range of machinery. Type-B standards are in turn divided into:
• Type-B1 standards on specific safety aspects, e.g., the electrical safety of machinery, the calculation of safety
distances, requirements for control systems
• Type-B2 standards on protective devices, e.g., two-hand control devices, physical guards and electro-sensitive
protective equipment
Type-C
Type
-C standards contain all safety requirements for a specific machine or a type of machine. If this standard
exists, it has priority over the type-A or type-B standard. A type-C standard may, however, refer to a type-B or type-A
standard. In all circumstances the requirements of the Machinery Directive shall be met.

European standardization organizations and structures
CEN (Comité Européen de Normalisation/European Committee for Standardization)
CEN is a gr oup of s
tandardization organizations from EU member states, the EFTA
countries as well as future members from CEN or EFTA. CEN prepares the European
Standards (EN) in non-electrical areas. To prevent these standards representing barri‐
ers to trade, CEN collaborates with ISO. Using a voting procedure, CEN determines
whether ISO standards are adopted and publishes them as European standards.
CENELEC (Comité Européen de Normalisation Electrotechnique/European Commit‐
tee f
or Electrotechnical Standardization)
CENELEC is the comparable institution to CEN in the area of electrical technology, and
prepares and publishes European standards (EN) in this area. CENELEC is increas‐
ingly adopting IEC standards and their numbering system.

Subject to change without notice\nNational standardization organizations and structures
As a rule each EU member state has its own standardization organization, e.g., DIN, ON, BSI, AFNOR. These
prepar
e and publish national standards in accordance with the legal requirements of the respective member
states. To provide harmonized health and safety in the European Community and to remove trade barriers, the
European standards are adopted by the national standardization organizations.
The following principles apply to the relationship between national and safety standards:
• If similar national standards exist for adopted European standards, the national standards shall be with‐
drawn.
• If no applicable European standards exist for specific aspects or machinery, existing national standards can
be applied.
• A national standardization organization is only allowed to draft a new national standard if this intention has
been announced and there is no interest at European level (at CEN or CENELEC).
European standards for machinery safety
Standards that describe the requirements of European directives in concrete detail in such a way that compliance
wit
h the standards provides presumption of conformity with the directives are referred to as “harmonized stand‐
ards”.
The status of the standard is indicated by various abbreviations:
• A standard with the prefix “EN” is recognized and can be applied in all EU states.
• A standard with the prefix “prEN” is currently in preparation.
• A document that also has “TS” as a prefix is a technical specification and is used as a preliminary standard.
These documents exist as CLC/TS or as CEN/TS.
• A document that also has “TR” as a prefix is a report on the state of the art.
A harmonized European standard is prepared as follows:
1. T
he EU Commission, as the executive organ of the EU, issues a mandate to CEN or CENELEC to draft a
European standard to specify in detail the requirements of a directive.
2. The preparatory work is undertaken in international technical committees in which the technical specifica‐
tions to meet the essential safety requirements in the directive(s) are defined.
3. Once the standard has been approved by the responsible technical committee in a final vote, it is reviewed
by the European Commission to determine whether the requirements contained in the standard sufficient to
fulfill the requirement of Annex I of the Machinery Directive listed in its Annex ZA. Annex ZA may list one,
several or all of the essential health and safety requirements.
4. If the European Commission considers that the standard adequately supports the relevant requirements of
Annex ZA, the standard is listed in the Official Journal of the European Union as a harmonized standard.
NOTE
• A har moni
zed European standard is used as a reference and replaces all national standards on the same
subject.
• The compliance of a safety component or a machine with the applicable harmonized standards provides
presumption of conformity with the essential health and safety requirements defined in directives, e.g., in the
Machinery Directive.
NOTE
A list of t
he standards with presumption of conformity with the directives is available at ec.europa.eu .§ – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS

Subject to change without notice\nNOTE
• The applic
ation of standards, independent of whether they are harmonized or not, is not a requirement of the
Machinery Directive. However, if harmonized standards are applied, the so-called “presumption of conformity”
applies, according to which it is assumed that the machine meets the relevant essential safety and health
requirements of the Machinery Directive.
• If a type-C standard exists for a machine type, it takes precedence over type-A and type-B standards. In this
case, only the type-C standard applied justifies the presumption of conformity for meeting the requirements
of the Machinery Directive.
Summary: Standards
• Europe an standards specify in more detail the objectives defined in the European directives.
• The application of harmonized standards provides the “presumption of conformity”, i.e., the presumption the
machine meets the requirements of the directive. In other words, if you select and apply the right standards
for your machine or system, you can assume that you will meet the legal requirements. In specific cases the
obligations on the manufacturer can go beyond the content of the standards if, for example, a standard no
longer reflects the state of the art.
• There are type-A standards (basic safety standards), type-B standards (generic safety standards), and type-C
standards (standards on the safety of machinery). If a type-C standard exists, it has priority over the type-A or
type-B standard.
Test bodies, insurance providers and market surveillance
Test bodies
Test bodies providing safety advice
Com
panies that want to know whether their machines are compliant with the applicable European directives and
standards can obtain advice on safety aspects.
Accredited test bodies
Ac
credited test bodies are test bodies that certify compliance with the test procedures and test criteria from
recognized national institutions. These test bodies may include institutions for occupational safety and health
which generally employ highly competent specialists.
Notified bodies
Each EU member s
tate has the obligation to nominate test bodies as per the minimum requirements defined in
the Machinery Directive, and to notify the European Commission in Brussels of these test bodies for listing.
Only these test bodies are authorized to perform EU-type examinations and to issue EU type examination certifi‐
cates for the machinery and safety components listed in Annex IV of the Machinery Directive. Not all notified test
bodies can test every type of product or machine. Many test bodies are only notified for specific areas.
Insurance providers
Berufsgenossenschaften (statutory OSH insurance bodies)/IFA – Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of

erman Social Accident Insurance
In Germany, the Berufsgenossenschaften and other organizations cover the legal accident insurance obligation.
The Berufsgenossenschaften are organized by branches so that specific requirements in the individual sectors of
the economy can be better met.§ – LAWS, DIRECTIVES, STANDARDS

Many insur
ance companies have departments that offer expert specialist advice, particularly in relation to the
prevention of liability risks that may result from ignorance or failure to comply with legal requirements.
Market surveillance
In the states of the EU and EFTA, work safety and market surveillance are the responsibility of national authorities.
• In Ger
many, this is the responsibility of the “Länder” agencies for occupational health and safety.
• Austria has a range of occupational safety inspectorates. Machine manufacturers can also contact national
authorities for expert advice in relation to questions about the safety of machinery and safety at work.
• In Switzerland, market supervision is the responsibility of the State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO).
The Swiss National Accident Insurance Fund (Suva), noted for its high levels of technical expertise, is
responsible for enforcement.

Subject to change without notice\n1 – Risk assessment
When designing a machine, the possible risks must be assessed and, where necessary, protective measures must
be applied t o pr
otect the operator from any hazards that may still be present.
The process of risk assessment supports the machine manufacturer in this task. A risk assessment is a sequence
of logical steps that facilitate the systematic analysis and evaluation of risks. The results of the risk assessment
must be taken into account when designing and constructing the machine (risk reduction).
The risk assessment should help to reduce or avoid risks. As a consequence it may identify necessary measures
to protect the operator from hazards. If necessary, the risk assessment process must be repeated several times.
The first process steps are intended to identify and assess hazards. This is followed by an evaluation and, if
necessary, risk mitigation. If the measure triggers a new hazard, the repeated risk assessment reveals this. Being
machine-related and application-specific, the risk assessment is already specified in many type-C standards. If this
is not the case or not applicable, the requirements of the type-A and type-B standards can be used.

Functions of the machine (definition of limits)
The risk assessment starts with the definition of the functions of the machine. These may include:1 – RISK ASSESSMENT
22 S P E C I A L  I N F O R M A T I O N  | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK
Subject to change without notice\n• The s pecification for the machine (what is produced, maximum production performance, materials to be
used)
• Physical limits and expected location
• Planned service life
• The intended functions and operating modes
• The malfunctions and disruptions to be expected
• The people involved in the machine process
• The products related to the machine
• Intended use but also the unintentional actions of the operator or the reasonably foreseeable misuse of the
machine
Reasonably foreseeable misuse
Re
asonably assumable, unintentional actions of the operator or foreseeable misuse may include:
• Loss of control of the machine by the operator (particularly on hand-held or portable machinery)
• Reflex actions by individuals in the event of a malfunction, a fault, or a failure during the use of the machine
• Human error due to lack of concentration or carelessness
• Human error due to the selection of the “path of least resistance” in the performance of a task
• Actions under pressure to keep the machine in operation whatever happens
• Actions by certain groups of people (e.g., children, youths, the disabled)
Expected malfunctions and faults
Ther
e is significant potential for hazards due to malfunctions and faults in the components relevant to functional‐
ity, in particular components of control systems. Examples:
• Reversing of a roller movement (with the result that hands are drawn in)
• Movement of a robot outside its programmed working area
Identification of hazards
After defining the function of the machine comes the most important step in the risk assessment on the machine.
This s
tep comprises the systematic identification of foreseeable hazards, hazardous situations, and/or hazardous
events.

Risk estimation and risk assessment
After the hazards have been identified, a risk estimation is to be undertaken for each hazardous situation
considered
.
Extent 
o
f harmRisikis a
function ofandProbability of 
occurrence
The risk related to each hazardous situation considered is determined by the following risk parameters:
• The e
xtent of harm that can be caused by the hazard (minor injury, serious injury, etc.)
• The probability of occurrence of this harm. This is determined by:
°The exposure of a person/persons to the hazard
°The occurrence of the hazardous event
°The technical and human possibilities for the prevention or limitation of harm
There are a variety of tools available for assessing risks, e.g., tables, risk graphs, numerical methods.
Based on the results of the risk estimation, the risk assessment determines whether the application of protective
measures is required and when the necessary risk reduction has been achieved.

Scalable Risk Analysis and Evaluation Method (SCRAM)
The method is used to evaluate the initial risk and to estimate the risk after applying inherently safe design
mea
sures. It also assists with estimating the effectiveness of the implemented technical protection measures
and/or the information for use.
This method, developed by SICK on the basis of ISO 12100, has proven itself over many years through its
practicality, plausibility, and reliability in preventing errors.
All 3 levels of risk reduction (3-step method) are considered by SCRAM:
• Safe design
• Technical protective measures
• Information for use1 – RISK ASSESSMENT

consider both the extent of the damage and the probability of occurrence of that damage. The risk elements used
in SCRAM include:

• the exposure of the person to the hazard
• the possibility of avoiding the hazard
• the probability of occurrence of the hazard

Risk assessment using Safexpert®
Figure 11: Risk assessment using the Safexpert® software from company ibf
The r
isk assessment process is also included in Safexpert®, a CE management software from company ibf. The
user is guided through the legal requirements and the requirements in the standards. This task is simplified by
the pre-defined list of hazards, the CE management software from ibf for structured risk assessment, and the
scheme for evaluating both the risk and the level of safety necessary in control systems. The necessary standards
are always kept up to date with the StandardManager and the update assistants. The hazards are evaluated
separately at each hazardous point and for each phase of the machine’s life cycle. Evaluating hazards individually
enables the ideal measures for risk reduction to be selected in each case. Safexpert® uses a combination of risk
graphs and matrices (tables). The estimation is made before (IN) and after (OUT) the protective measure (e.g.,
protective device) has been selected. The risk is categorized on a scale from 0 (no risk) to 10 (highest risk).1 – RISK ASSESSMENT

General
• Per
form a risk assessment for all hazards. This iterative process must take into account all hazards and risks
until there are no residual risks or only acceptable residual risks remain.
Risk assessment process
• St
art the risk assessment by establishing the functions and the limits of the machine.
• During the risk assessment, take into account in particular reasonably foreseeable misuse and malfunctions.
• Then identify the hazards (mechanical, electrical, thermal,etc.) derived from the operation of the machine.
Take into account these hazards in all life phases of the machine.
• Then estimate the risks derived from the hazards. These depend on the extent of harm and the probability of
occurrence of the harm.
• Document the results of your risk assessment.1 – RISK ASSESSMENT

Subject to change without notice\n2 Safe design (inherently safe design)
Safe design is the first and most important step in the risk reduction process. During this process, possible
haz
ards are excluded by design. Safe design is therefore the most effective approach.
Aspects of safe design relate to the machine itself and the interaction between the person at risk and the
machine.
Examples:
• Mechanical design
• Operating and maintenance concept
• Electrical equipment (electrical safety, EMC)
• Strategies for emergency stop in an emergency situation
• Equipment involving fluids
• Materials and resources used
• Machine function and production process
All components should be selected, applied and adapted in such a way that the safety of persons is maintained
in the event of a machine error. The prevention of harm to the machine and the environment shall also be
considered. All elements of the machine shall be designed to operate within the specified limits. The design
should be as simple as possible. Safety-related functions shall be separated from other functions as far as
possible.
Mechanical design
The following measures are examples of how mechanical design can prevent the arising of hazards:
• Av
oiding sharp edges, corners, and protruding parts
• Avoiding crushing points, shearing points, and entanglement points
• Limiting kinetic energy (mass and speed)
• Considering ergonomic principles

The need for exposure to the hazard should be kept as low as possible. This can be achieved, for example, by:
• Aut
omatic loading and unloading stations
• Setup and maintenance work from the “outside”
• Use of reliable, available components to prevent maintenance work
• Clear and unambiguous operating concept, for example grouping operating elements according to related
functions (e.g., for setup operation)

Electrical equipment
Measures are required to exclude electrical hazards on machines. It is necessary to distinguish between two types
of ha z
ard:
• Hazards arising from electrical power, i.e., hazards due to direct or indirect contact
• Hazards arising from situations indirectly due to errors in the control system
NOTE
- In t he f
ollowing sections you will find important information on the design of the electrical equipment.

Power supply connection
The electrical power supply connection is the interface between the electrical equipment in the machine and the
suppl y g
rid. The regulations of the respective electricity grid operator on the connection must be observed.
A stable power supply is particularly important in safety-related applications. For this reason, the power supply
should be able to bridge brief power outages.2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN)

Subject to change without notice\nEarthing system
The e
arthing system characterizes both the type of connection on the secondary side of the supply transformer
to earth and the type of earthing for the electrical equipment’s chassis. Three earthing systems are standardized
internationally:
• TN system
• TT system
• IT system
Earthing is an electrically conductive connection to the earth. A differentiation is made between protective
earthing (PE), which is related to electrical safety, and functional earthing (FE), which is used for other purposes.
The protective conductor system comprises earth electrodes, connecting cables, and the related terminals. For
equipotential bonding, all conductive and accessible parts of the machine must be connected to the protective
conductor system. Equipotential bonding is a basic means of protection in the event of a fault.

TN system
The T
N system is the most common form of network in low voltage systems. In the TN system, the star point
of the transformer is directly connected to earth (system earthing). The chassis of the equipment connected are
connected to the transformer’s star point via the protective conductor (PE).
Depending on the wire cross-section laid, PE and N conductors are laid as a common conductor (TN-C system) or
as two independent conductors (TN-S system).
TT system
In a T T s
ystem, the star point of the supply transformer is earthed in the same way as in a TN system. The
protective conductor connected to the electrically conductive equipment housing is not connected to this star
point, but is earthed separately. The chassis of the equipment can also be earthed using a common protective
earth electrode.
TT systems are usually only used in connection with residual current circuit breakers.
The advantage of the TT system lies in its increased reliability for remote areas.
IT system
The conduc
tive housings of the equipment in an IT system are earthed in the same way as in a TT system, but the
star point of the feeding transformer is not. Systems in which a shutdown will result in a hazardous situation and
which should therefore not be shut down yet in the event of a single short-circuit or earth fault are designed as IT
systems.
In the low-voltage area, IT systems are required, for example, to supply operating rooms and intensive care stations
in hospitals.2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN)

Mains disconnection device
According to IEC 60204-1, a mains disconnection device must be provided for every power supply connection to
one or mor e mac
hines. It must be able to isolate the electrical equipment from the power supply.
The following disconnection devices can be used for this purpose:
• Power circuit breaker for use category AC-23B or DC-23B
• Isolating switch with auxiliary contact for leading load shedding
• Circuit breaker
• Plug/socket combination up to 16 A / 3 kW
Certain circuits such as control circuits for interlocking functions do not need to be shut down by the isolation
device. In this case special precautions must be taken to ensure the safety of operators.
Power isolation to prevent unexpected start-up
When working on the machine (maintenance, cleaning, servicing, etc.), a machine start or the restoration of power
shall no t r
esult in a hazard for the persons involved. When mains disconnection devices are used, means shall
be provided to prevent unintentional and/or mistaken switching of the power supply isolation device. This can be
achieved, for example, by blocking the main switch in the “OFF” position with a padlock.
NOTE
This po
wer isolation device is not suitable for use as a protective measure for brief interventions into the hazard‐
ous area for operational purposes.
Protection against electric shock
Protection classes
The c
lassification into different protection classes describes the means by which single-fault safety is achieved.
This categorization does not provide an indication of the level of protection.
Table 8: Symbols and explanations of protection classes
Protection class I
All de v
ices with simple insulation (basic insulation) and a protective conduction connection are in protection
class I. The protective conductor must be connected to a terminal marked with the earthing symbol or PE and be
green-yellow.
Protection class II
Eq
uipment in protection class II has increased insulation or double insulation and is not connected to the protec‐
tive conductor. This protective measure is also known as protective insulation. There shall be no connection of a
protective conductor.
Protection Class III
Eq
uipment in protection class III operates with a safety extra-low voltage and, therefore, does not require any
explicit protection.
Safety extra-low voltage SELV/PELV
AC v
oltages up to 50 volts (V RMS) and DC voltages up to 120 volts are allowed as safety extra-low voltages. Above
75 volts DC, the requirements of the Low Voltage Directive must also be observed.2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN)

Subject to change without notice\nIn the case of applications in normally dry rooms, it is not necessary to provide protection against direct contact
(ba
sic protection) if the rms value of the AC voltage does not exceed 25 V or the harmonic-free DC voltage does
not exceed 60 V. A harmonic-free state exists when the DC voltage is superimposed with a sinusoidal AC voltage
component of no more than 10% effective.
The safety extra-low voltage circuit shall be safely separated from other circuits (adequate air and creepage
distances, insulation, connection of circuits to the protective conductor, etc.).
Two safety extra-low voltages are distinguished:
• SELV (safety extra-low voltage)
• PELV (protective extra-low voltage)

Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC)
Electromagnetic compatibility is “the ability of a device, unit of equipment or system to function satisfactorily in
its e
lectromagnetic environment without introducing intolerable electromagnetic disturbances to anything in that
environment”.
The machine and the components used shall be selected and verified so that they can withstand or are immune to
the expected disturbances. Increased requirements apply to safety components.
Electromagnetic disturbances can arise from the following causes:
• Fast, transient, electrical disturbances (burst)
• Surge voltages, e.g., caused by lightning strikes to the grid
• Electromagnetic fields
• High-frequency disturbance (neighboring cables)
• Electrostatic discharge (ESD)
The limits for interference immunity and interference emission are different for industrial and residential applica‐
tions. More stringent requirements apply to components in the industrial sector. On the one hand they must
withstand stronger disturbances, but on the other hand they are allowed to interfere more strongly. Components
that meet the RF interference requirements in the industrial sector may cause RF interference in residential areas.
The following table shows examples of the typical interference immunity in a number of areas of application, in
each case in the frequency range from 900 to 2 000 MHz.

Basic design rules to avoid EMC problems
• Ensur e c ontinuous equipotential bonding by means of conductive connections between parts of machinery
and systems.
• Apply physical separation of the control and measuring components from the supply unit, e.g., power supply
units, contactors, actuators, inverters.
• Do not use the shielding to carry equipotential bonding currents.
• Use short shields and apply to the full surface area.
• Connect any functional earth (FE) provided.
• Terminate existing communication lines properly according to the manufacturer's specifications, e.g., using a
terminator.
Twisted cables are often required to transmit data (fieldbus).

Fluid technology
Fluid technology is the generic term used for all processes where energy is transmitted using gases or liquids.
The g
eneric term is used because liquids and gases behave similarly. Fluid technology describes processes and
systems for the transmission of power using fluids in closed pipe systems.
Subsystems
Ev
ery fluid-related system comprises the following subsystems:
• Compressing: compressor/pump
• Conditioning: filters
• Pumping: pipework/hoses
• Controlling: valve
• Driving: cylinder
Pressure is established in any fluid-related system by pumping the fluid against loads. If the load increases, the
pressure also increases.
Fluid technology is applied in engineering in hydraulics (energy transmission using hydraulic oils) and in pneumat‐
ics (energy transmission using compressed air). Oil-based hydraulics required a circuit for the fluid (feed and
return), while in pneumatics the exhaust air is discharged to the environment using acoustic attenuators.
Design principles
The ba
sic principles for the safe application of fluid technology are described in ISO 4413 (hydraulics) and
ISO 4414 (pneumatics). All parts of a fluid-related system are to be protected against pressures that exceed the
maximum operating pressure of a subsystem or the rated pressure of a component. A danger shall not be caused
by leaks in a component or in the pipework/hoses. Acoustic attenuators are to be used to reduce the noise caused
by escaping air. The use of acoustic attenuators shall not produce any additional hazard; acoustic attenuators
shall not cause any harmful back-pressure.2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN)

Protection against explosions is a particularly safety-related task. People are placed at risk in the event of an
explosion, e
.g., due to uncontrolled radiation of heat, flames, pressure waves, and flying debris, as well as due
to harmful reaction products and the consumption of the oxygen in the ambient air necessary for breathing.
Explosions and fires are not among the most common causes of industrial accidents. They often result, however,
in serious injuries and death as well as major economic damage.
Where dust, flammable gases, or liquids are manufactured, transported, processed, or stored, a potentially explo‐
sive atmosphere may be produced, i.e., a mixture of fuel and atmospheric oxygen within the limits for explosions. If
a source of ignition is present, an explosion will occur.

Mechanics, electronics, operation
• The mos
t effective and important measure is safe design to prevent hazards from occurring in the first place.
• Design so that the operators are exposed to the hazardous area as little as possible.
• Avoid dangers produced directly due to electrical power (direct and indirect contact) or produced indirectly
due to faults in the control system.
Stopping
• Plan a cont
rol device for stopping the machine in normal operation.
EMC
• De
sign machines that meet applicable EMC requirements. The components used must be selected and
verified so as to meet the following criteria:
°Comply with electromagnetic disturbance limits to not interfere with other equipment or devices
°Ensure immunity to the expected disturbances
°Comply with limit values for the area of application2 SAFE DESIGN (INHERENTLY SAFE DESIGN)

Subject to change without notice\n3 – Technical protective measures
A technical protective measure is implemented by means of one or more safety functions. Each safety function
compr
ises at least one protective device. There are three types of protective devices:
• Mechanical protective devices that retain parts, substances, or radiation or permanently prevent entry/
access.
• Protective devices that are integrated into the controller of the machine to initiate the safe state as soon as
persons or parts of the human body are detected.
• Protective devices that are integrated into the controller of the machine to initiate the safe state as soon as
the monitored safety-related limits of machine parameters (position, speed, force, etc.) are exceeded.
All these protective devices implement safety functions, but not every protective device has to be integrated into
the machine controller for this purpose. Fixed physical guards (fences, barriers, covers), for example, are not
integrated into the machine controller but if designed correctly, such guards fulfill the requirement of the safety
function.
Functional safety
When pr
otective devices are integrated into the machine controller, the risk reduction relies on the correct
functioning of the controller. In this case, we refer to this as functional safety. When implementing functional
safety, the required safety level must be determined for each safety function. The requirements of each particular
protective measure must be implemented using suitable components.
Validation
The v
alidation of all technical protective measures ensures that the safety functions reliably reduce the risk.
The design of technical protective measures and safety functions and the methodology for their implementation in
the control system form the content of the next chapter (sub-steps 3a to 3e).3 – TECHNICAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES

The safety functions describe how risks are reduced by protective measures. At least one safety function must be
def
ined for each hazard that has not been eliminated by the design.
It is necessary to precisely describe the safety function in order to achieve the required safety with reasonable
effort. The type and number of components required for the function are derived from the definition of the safety
function.

ples for the definition of safety functions: IFA Report 2/2017, “Functional safety of machine controls”
Permanently preventing entry/access
Access to a hazardous point is prevented by means of
mechanic
al covers, barriers, or obstacles (referred to as
physical guards).
Examples:
• Prevention of direct access to hazardous points
using covers (see figure)
• Distancing protective devices (e.g., tunnels) to pre‐
vent access to the hazardous points and allow the
passage of materials or goods (see figure)
• Prevention of access to hazardous areas using
physical guards

pack
aging machine by means of a tunnel3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS

Subject to change without notice\nTemporarily preventing access
Access to a hazardous point is prevented until the
machine is in a s
afe state.
Examples:
• On request, a machine stop is initiated. When the
machine reaches the safe state, the blocking of
access by the safety locking device is released.
• After disconnecting the power, a transfer key
that allows access (opening the movable physical
guard) is enabled.

point in a s t
retch film wrapper by means of a safety locking
device
Retaining parts/substances/radiation
If parts can be ejected out of machines or radiation can
arise
, mechanical protective devices (physical guards)
must be used to prevent these hazards.
Examples:
• Protection hood with special viewing window on
a milling machine to protect against ejected shav‐
ings and tool parts
• Fence that can hold back a robot

Subject to change without notice\nInitiating a stop
The purpose of a safety-related stop function is to place
the mac
hine in a safe state when requested (e.g., if a
person approaches). To reduce the required stopping
time, it may be advisable to implement a stop function
that complies with stop category 1 (IEC 60204-1 "Stop‐
ping", page 35 ). Additional safety functions may be nec‐
essary to prevent an unexpected restart.
Examples:
• Opening a protective door with an interlock that
has no locking device
• Interruption of the light beam of a safety light-
beam sensor that protects against access
Figure 22: Initiating a stop by a safety multibeam sensor on a
palle t handlin
g machine when a person approaches
Avoiding an unexpected start-up
After the “Initiating a stop” function is triggered or
the mac
hine is switched on, it should require deliber‐
ate actions to put the machine into operation. These
actions include manually resetting a protective device
to prepare for restarting the machine (see also section
"Application of reset and restart", page 110 )
Examples:
• Resetting a safety light curtain (see figure: blue
“Reset” button)
• Resetting the emergency stop device

re
setting the safety light curtain3A – DEFINING THE SAFETY FUNCTIONS

Subject to change without notice\nPreventing start
After the “Initiating a stop” function, technical meas‐
ure
s should be used to prevent the machine from start‐
ing or being put back into operation as long as there
are persons in the hazardous area.
Examples:
• Use of a trapped key system: Restoration of power
is only possible using the transfer key. The transfer
key is only available when the means of access
(movable physical guard) is closed and locked.

To move materials in or out of the hazardous area, spe‐
cific f
eatures of the materials moved are used for mate‐
rial detection or to automatically differentiate between
material and people. The protective device is then not
actuated during material transport; however, people are
detected.
Examples:
• Selecting suitable sensors and placing them in
appropriate positions enables the material to be
detected and the safety function to be tempora‐
rily suspended while the material passes through
(muting).
• Protective field switching on a safety laser scanner
• Horizontal light curtains with integrated algorithm
for human-material differentiation

e detailed information, see section see "Automatic material passage using ESPE", page 78 .
Monitoring machine parameters
In some applications, it is necessary to monitor various
machine par
ameters for safety-related limits. If a limit
is exceeded, suitable measures are initiated (e.g., stop,
warning signal).
Examples:
• Monitoring of speed, temperature, or pressure
• Position monitoring for collision avoidance

Subject to change without notice\nSafeguarding work areas shared by humans and machines
If the operation of a machine requires a workspace
to whic
h both a worker and hazardous parts of the
machine (e.g., a robot) need access at different times,
it must be ensured that any contact or collision is
avoided.
Additional safety functions may be necessary to avoid
an unexpected restart.

robo
ts using safety light curtains
Disabling safety functions manually and for a limited time
If it is necessary for setup work or process monitoring
to oper
ate the machine with the protective function
of the protective devices disabled, a suitable operat‐
ing mode should be provided that meets the following
requirements:
• Operating mode is only activated when an operat‐
ing mode selector switch is in the corresponding
position.
• Operating mode locks all other control and operat‐
ing modes of the machine.
• Operating mode does not allow machine move‐
ments due to direct or indirect action on sensors
or linked sequences.
• Operating mode allows dangerous machine func‐
tions only while command devices (e.g., enabling
switch) are continuously actuated and under
reduced risk conditions (e.g. limitation of speed,
movement path, function duration).

Subject to change without notice\nCombining or switching safety functions
A machine can adopt various states or work in various
oper a
ting modes. Within this context, different safety
measures may be effective or different safety functions
may be coupled together. The process of switching
between operating modes, or the selection and adjust‐
ment of different safety measures, is not allowed to
lead to a dangerous state. When combining or changing
safety functions, an appropriate safety level must also
be determined and implemented.
Examples:
• After a change of operating mode between setup
and normal operation, the machine is stopped. A
new manual start command is necessary.
• Adapting the monitored area of a safety laser
scanner according to the vehicle speed

Emergency stop
Emergency stop is a complementary protective meas‐
ure and no
t a protective device.
The safety level of this function shall be defined based
on the risk assessment of the machine. In particu‐
lar, influencing environmental factors (e.g., vibration,
method of actuation, etc.) shall be considered (see also
section "Emergency operation", page 89 ).

Subject to change without notice\nSafety-related indications and alarms
Safety-related indications are means of providing the
user w it
h information about impending hazards (e.g.,
overspeed) or possible residual risks. These kind of
signals can also be used to warn the operator before
automatic protective measures are initiated.
The following should be noted:
• Warning devices must be designed and arranged
so that they can easily be checked and inspected.
• The information for use shall include the prescrip‐
tion of the regular inspection of warning equip‐
ment.
• Sensorial saturation should be avoided, in particu‐
lar where audible alarms are concerned.
Examples:
• Interlocking indications
• Startup warning devices
• Muting lamps

Other functions
Safety devices can also perform other functions. The actual safety functions must not be impaired as a result of
this
.
Examples:
• Tool and machine protection
• PSDI mode (cycle initiation - see "Additional functions of ESPE", page 81  ff)
• Using the measurement data of a safety laser scanner to navigate an autonomous vehicle
Summary: Defining the safety functions
Define which safety functions are required for risk reduction:
• Per
manently preventing entry/access
• Temporarily preventing access
• Retaining parts/substances/radiation
• Initiating a stop
• Avoiding an unexpected start-up
• Preventing start
• Combination of initiating a stop/preventing start
• Allowing material passage
• Monitoring machine parameters
• Safeguarding work areas shared by humans and machines

Subject to change without notice\n3b – Determining the required safety level
As a rule, type-C standards (machine-specific standards) shall specify the required safety level.
The r
equired safety level must be defined separately for each safety function, and applies for all devices involved,
for example …
• the sensor/the protective device
• the evaluating logic unit
• the power control element(s)
If no type-C standard exists for the particular machine or the type-C standard does not contain any requirements
relating to this, the required safety level can be determined on the basis of one of the following standards:
NOTE
- IS O 13849-1
-
 IEC 62061
By applying these standards it can be ensured that the effort required to reduce the risk is reasonable for the
ris
k that has been determined. The protection of an operator who manually inserts and removes parts at a metal
press requires a different risk reduction compared to the protection of an operator who works on a machine on
which the maximum risk is the trapping of a finger. Safety functions shall be specified individually for each phase
of the machine’s life cycle and hazard, since one and the same machine can have different hazardous points with
different risks during different phases of the lifecycle.
The risk assessment is based on the following parameters:
• The severity of the possible injury/damage to health
• Frequency and/or duration of exposure
• The possibility of preventing the hazard
By combining these parameters, the required safety level can be determined. Some standards contain suitable
methods for this determination. The risk assessment always starts without considering risk reduction measures.
Required performance level (PLr) according to ISO 13849-1
This standard uses a risk graph to determine the required risk reduction level. The parameters S, F and P are used
to de
termine the magnitude of the risk.
The result of the procedure is a “required performance level” (PLr).3B – DETERMINING THE REQUIRED SAFETY LEVEL

erformance level
Low risk High riskFigure 33: Risk graph according to ISO 13849-1
The per
formance level is defined in five discrete steps. The performance level depends on the structure of the
control system, the reliability of the components used, the ability to detect faults as well as the resistance to
common cause faults in multi-channel controllers (see section "Safety-related aspects of subsystems", page 56 ).
In addition, further measures to avoid design faults are required.
If the probability of occurrence of a hazardous event can be assessed as low, the PLr may be reduced by one
level. This method is described in Annex A of the standard. This annex is informative and not normative. It is not
necessary, therefore, to apply the process described there in order to fully comply with the requirements of the
standard.
The SCRAM method from SICK can also be used as an alternative. The advantage is the universal applicability
and the finer granularity of the decision parameters see "Scalable Risk Analysis and Evaluation Method (SCRAM)",
page 24 .
Required safety integrity level (SIL) according to IEC 62061
The procedure used here is a numerical procedure. The severity, the frequency and duration of exposurein the
haz
ardous area, and the probability of avoiding or limiting harm are evaluated. In addition, the probability of
occurrence of the hazardous event is taken into consideration. The result is the required safety integrity level (SIL).

The SIL is determined as follows:

termine the severity Se.
• Determine values for the Frequency Fr, Probability Pr, and Avoidance Pv.
• Calculate the Class Cl from the sum of Fr + Pr + Pv.
• The required SIL is the intersection between the row “Severity Se” and the column “Class Cl”
The SIL is defined in three discrete steps. The SIL implemented depends on the structure of the control system,
the reliability of the components used, the ability to detect faults as well as the resistance to multiple common
cause faults in multiple channel control systems. In addition, further measures to avoid design faults are required
(see "Safety-related aspects of subsystems", page 56 ).
Summary: Determining the required level of safety
General
• De
fine the necessary level of safety for each safety function.
• The parameters “severity”, “probability of occurrence” and “probability of avoiding damage” determine the
required safety level.
Applicable standards
• ISO 13849-1 use
s a risk graph to determine the required safety level. The result of the procedure is a
“required performance level” (PLr).
• ISO 13849-1 is also applicable to hydraulic, pneumatic, and mechanical systems.
• IEC 62061 uses a numerical method to determine the required safety level. The result is a required safety
integrity level (SIL).3B – DETERMINING THE REQUIRED SAFETY LEVEL

Steps 3c and 3d describe the design and verification of the safety functions. These steps may need to be
perf
ormed several times in an iterative process.
Step 3c includes the development of the safety concept, the selection of the protective devices, the integration
into the controller, and the verification of the safety function.
NOTE
Durin
g this process it is necessary to repeatedly check whether the selection of the technology offers sufficient
safety and is also technically feasible, or whether other risks or additional risks are produced by the use of a
specific technology.
Safety concept
Develop a concept for the required safety functions.
A mac hine or s
ystem consists of several components that interact and ensure the functionality of a machine or
system.
A distinction must be made here between components that perform pure operating tasks and ones that are
responsible for safety-related functions.

Subject to change without notice\nThe safety-related parts of control systems shall be selected to suit the safety functions and the necessary level
of saf
ety. These parts include sensors, logic units, power control elements, for example, as well as drive and work
elements. This selection is usually made while developing the safety concept.
A safety function can be implemented using one or more safety-related component(s). Several safety functions
can share one or more components. Control systems shall be designed to avoid hazardous situations. It must be
possible to start machinery only by voluntary actuation of a control device provided for the purpose.
If a machine restart will pose a hazard, then restarting on switching on the supply voltage shall be excluded by
technical means.
If a machine restart will not pose a hazard, then restarting without operator intervention (automatic restart) is
permitted.
Subsystems of the safety-related part of a machine control system
The drive elements shall be designed 
a
ccording to “good engineering 
practice”. They are only part of the 
safety function if their failure may 
lead to a hazard (e.g., suspended axes).

Decisive factors
The following features shall be considered when developing the safety concept:
• Fe
atures of the machine
• Features of the surroundings
• Human aspects
• Features of the design
• Features of protective devices ( see "Technology, selection and use of protective devices", page 60 )
Which protective devices are to be integrated and how they are to be integrated must be defined based on the
above features.
Features of the machine
The f
ollowing features of the machine shall be considered:
• Ability to stop the dangerous movement at any time (if not possible, use guards or impeding devices)
• Ability to stop the dangerous movement without additional hazards (if not possible, select different design/
protective device)
• Possibility of hazard due to ejected parts (if yes: use physical guards)
• Stopping times (knowledge of stopping times is necessary to ensure the protective device is effective)
• Possibility of monitoring stopping time/overrun (this is necessary if changes could occur due to aging/wear)
Features of the surroundings
The f
ollowing features of the surroundings shall be considered:
• Electromagnetic disturbances, radiated interference
• Vibration, shock
• Ambient light, light interfering with sensors/welding sparks
• Reflective surfaces
• Contamination (mist, chips)3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

• Moisture, weather
Human aspects
The f
ollowing human aspects shall be considered:
• Expected qualification of the machine’s operator
• Expected number of persons in the area
• Approach speed (K)
• Possibility of defeating the protective devices
• Reasonably foreseeable misuse
Features of the design
A saf
ety function is performed by several subsystems. It is always advisable to implement safety functions
with certified safety components. Certified safety components will simplify the design process and subsequent
verification.
It is often not possible to implement a subsystem using only certified safety components that readily provide
the level of safety (PL/SIL). In fact, the subsystem frequently has to be assembled from a number of discrete
elements. In this case, the safety level depends on various safety-related aspects, see "Safety-related aspects of
subsystems", page 56.
Safety-related aspects of subsystems
The safety level of a subsystem is dependent on various safety-related aspects, for example:
• St
ructure
• Reliability of the components/devices
• Diagnostics for detecting faults
• Resistance to common cause failures
• Process

Structure
To r
educe the susceptibility of a safety component to fault by means of a better structure, the safety-related
functions can be executed in parallel on more than one channel. Dual-channel safety-related systems are common
in the machine safety sector (see figure below). Each channel can perform the intended safety function. The
two channels can be of diverse design (e.g., one channel uses electromechanical components, the other only
electronics). Instead of a second equivalent channel, the second channel can also have a pure monitoring
function.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Reliability of the safety components/devices
The f
ailure of safety-related components or devices may lead to disturbances in the machine process and to
hazards. These components should therefore offer a high level of reliability. The higher the reliability, the lower the
probability of a dangerous failure. The data for reliability describe the number of random failures during the service
life of the components. These values are usually specified as:
• B10 value  for electromechanical or pneumatic components. Here, service life is determined by switching
frequency. The B10 value  indicates the number of switching cycles until 10% of components fail.
• Failure rate λ (lambda value) for electronic components. The failure rate is often expressed in FITs (Failures In
Time). One FIT is one failure per 109 hours.

Diagnostics for detecting faults
Some f
aults can be detected by diagnostic measures. Diagnostic measures include plausibility monitoring, current
and voltage monitoring, watchdog functionality, brief function test.
Since all faults cannot always be detected, the degree of fault detection must be defined. A Failure Mode and
Effects Analysis (FMEA) should be performed for this purpose. For complex designs, measures and empirical
values from standards provide assistance.
Resistance to common cause faults
The t
erm common cause fault is used, for example, to refer to both channels failing simultaneously due to
interference.
Appropriate measures must be taken to prevent this, e.g., isolated cable routing, suppressors, diversity of compo‐
nents.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Physical guards
Physical guards are mechanical protective devices that prevent hazardous points from being reached directly using
part
s of the body. They can be fixed or movable. Physical guards include, for example, covers, fences, barriers,
flaps and protective doors. Covers and hoods prevent access from all sides. Fences are generally used to prevent
full body access while barriers can only prevent unintentional or unconscious access to the hazardous points.
The safety function is essential for the design of guards. Must, for example, the physical guard only prevent
access, and/or also retain parts and radiation?
Examples of ejected parts:
• Bre
aking/bursting tools (grinding wheels, drills)
• Emitted materials (dust, chips, slivers, particles)
• Blown out materials (hydraulic oil, compressed air, lubricant, materials)
• Parts ejected after the failure of a clamping or handling system
Examples of radiation sources:
• Ther
mal radiation from the process or the products (hot surfaces)
• Optical radiation from lasers, IR or UV sources
• Particle or ion radiation
• Strong electromagnetic fields, high frequency equipment
• High voltages from test systems or systems for discharging electrostatic charges (paper and plastic webs)3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\nNOTE
The mec
hanical requirements for guards intended to contain radiation or ejected materials are generally higher
than those for fixed guards intended to prevent access of persons.
Damage (breakage or deformation) to a physical guard is permitted in cases in which the risk assessment
determines that no hazards will result.
General requirements on physical guards
• Pro
tective devices (guards) shall be designed to be adequately robust and durable to ensure they withstand
the environmental conditions to be expected during operation. The properties of guards shall be maintained
during the entire period of use of the machines.
• They shall not cause any additional dangers.
• It shall not be possible to easily bypass the guards or render them ineffective.
• Guards shall not restrict observation of the working process more than necessary, insofar that observation is
necessary.
• Guards shall be firmly held in place.
• They shall be fastened either by systems that can only be opened with tools, or they shall be interlocked with
the dangerous movement.
• As far as possible, they should not remain in the protective position if unfastened.
NOTE
- Ph
ysical guards: ISO 14120
- Principles for safe machine design: ISO 12100 (type-A standard)
Mounting guards
Guar ds t
hat are not removed or opened very often or are only removed or opened for maintenance work shall be
fastened to the machine frame so that they can only be removed with tools (e.g., spanner, key). The process to
remove them must be similar to a mounting operation and tools must be required.
Fastening elements on guards that are disassembled or removed regularly shall be designed so that they cannot
be lost (e.g., captive screws).
Other types of fastening such as quick-release fasteners, screws with knobs, knurled screws, and wing nuts are
only allowed if the guard is interlocked.
Allowed Not permitted
Figure 41: Example: Types of fastening for physical guards
Movable physical guards
Movable guards that need to be opened frequently or regularly without tools (e.g., for setup work) must be
func
tionally linked to the dangerous machine function (interlocking, locking device). The term frequent opening is
used, e.g., if the guard is opened at least once during a shift.
If hazards are to be expected when a guard is opened (e.g., very long stopping time), locking devices are required.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\nErgonomic requirements to be met by movable physical guards
Erg
onomic aspects are also significant during the design of protective devices. Guards will only be accepted
by employees if they do not hinder setup, maintenance, and other similar activities any more than necessary.
Movable physical guards must meet the following ergonomic criteria:
• Easy (e.g., one-handed) opening and closing, lifting, or moving
• Functional handle
• Opened guards should allow convenient access.
Mechanical locking of movable physical guards
As f
ar as feasible, movable physical guards must be joined to the machine so that they can be securely held in the
open position by hinges, guides, etc. Positive-fit mountings are preferred. Friction mountings (e.g., ball fasteners)
are not recommended due to their diminishing effectiveness (wear).
Table 20: Example: Locking guards
Good Possible
Interlocking physical guards
Physical guards must be interlocked if they have the following characteristics:
• Are ac
tuated cyclically or opened regularly (doors, flaps)
• Can be removed without tools or easily (e.g., covers)
• Protect against a potentially serious hazard
Interlocking means that the opening of the guard is converted into an electrical signal that stops the dangerous
movement. Physical guards are normally interlocked using position switches.
The interlocking of a physical guard should fulfill the following functions:
• The dangerous machine function cannot be initiated with the guard open (missing) (preventing start).
• The dangerous machine functions are stopped when the guard is opened (removed) (initiating a stop).
The following section describes the essential requirements on interlocking devices associated with physical guards
according to ISO 14119.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\nSafety switches, position switches and interlocking devices
The commonl
y used term “safety switch” does not appear in the standards because the multitude of technologies
and suitable sensor designs for interlocking devices does not allow general requirements to be defined.
Regardless of the technology used (mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, hydraulic), the following definitions apply:
• An interlocking device consists of an actuator and a position switch.
• A position switch consists of an actuator and an output signal element.
Depending on the technology of the position switch used and the functional safety requirements, either one or
more interlocking devices will be required for a physical guard.
Mechanical attachment
Re
liable mechanical attachment of the position switches and actuators is crucial for their effectiveness. The
elements of interlocking devices
• shall be fitted such that they are protected against damage due to foreseeable external effects.
• shall not be used as a mechanical stop.
• shall be secured against unintentional operation and damage by means of their arrangement and design.
• shall be secured against unintentional changes in position by their arrangement, design and fastening.
secured. If necessary, the switch and the actuating element must be secured by means of positive locking,
e.g., with round holes, dowel pins, stops.
• shall be protected by their actuation method, or their integration in the control shall be such that they cannot
be easily bypassed.
• shall be possible to check the switches for correct operation and, if possible, they shall be easily accessible
for inspection.

Correct mounting:  The posit ion switch is
protected by a mechanical stop.Incorrect mounting:  The posit ion switch
is used as a stop.Correct mounting:  The hei ght of the cam
has been matched to the position switch.
Positive mechanical actuation or interlocking arrangement
When usin
g mechanical interlocking devices, reliable actuation is important. The use of positive mechanical
actuation in an interlocking device ensures that the position switch is actuated when the guard is opened and
reduces possibilities for manipulation. Positive mechanical actuation is the forced movement of the mechanical
components of the interlocking device (safety switch) through direct contact with mechanical components or with
the physical guard (e.g., protective door).3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

safety circuit, e.g., if the plunger is sticking due to incrusta‐
tions or lubricating oil that has solidified.
Source: BG Feinmechanik und Elektrotechnik, BGI 575
Positive opening
A cont ac
t element is positive-opening if the switching contacts are isolated immediately by a defined movement
of the actuating element by non-elastic parts (e.g., springs). The use of positive opening normally closed contacts
in position switches with positive mechanical actuation ensures that electrical circuit is still isolated even if the
contacts are worn or other electrical faults have occurred.
The following requirements also apply where positive-opening mechanical position switches are concerned:
• The actuating travel shall be set to suit the positive-opening travel.
• The minimum plunger travel specified by the manufacturer shall be observed in order to provide the switching
distance required for positive opening.
Figure 42: Symbol for positive opening normally closed contacts in accordance with IEC 60947-5-1, Annex K
NOTE
The use of bo
th redundantly monitored electronic outputs from electro-sensitive position switches is considered
equivalent to positive opening. If a type 3 or type 4 interlocking device is the only interlocking device on a physical
guard, it must meet the requirements of IEC 60947-5-3.
Manipulation prevention
When de
signing interlocking devices, designers shall consider the possible motivation for manipulation of the
protective device and foreseeable manipulation into account.
Measures to counter manipulation with simple means shall be applied.
Simple means include screws, needles, sections of sheet steel, coins, bent wire or the like.
Possible means of avoiding simple attempts to manipulate interlocking devices include:
• Making interlocking devices difficult to access by using concealed assembly or assembly out of reach
• Using position switches with coded actuators
• Mounting the elements of the interlocking switches with “one-way” fasteners (e.g., safety screws, rivets)
• Manipulation monitoring in the control system (plausibility checks, testing)3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION
8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK S P E C I A L  I N F O R M A T I O N  | Guide for Safe Machinery 65
Subject to change without notice\nRedundant design
The cr
itical failure of an individual safety switch can be caused by manipulation, a mechanical error on the
actuator or position switch (e.g., aging), or the effects of extreme ambient conditions (food industry example:
stuck roller plunger due to contamination with flour). In particular at higher safety levels it is necessary to use
an additional position switch, e.g., with the opposite function to that of the first position switch, and to have both
switches monitored by the control system.
Example: An injection molding machine with cyclically actuated front protective doors. This application requires two
mechanical switches.

Locking devices
Loc
king devices are devices that prevent guards from opening. They shall be applied if the stopping time of the
dangerous machine state is longer than the time a person needs to reach the hazardous area (safety function
"Temporarily preventing access", page 44 ). Locking devices shall prevent access to hazardous areas until the
dangerous machine state has passed. Locking devices are also required if a process shall not be interrupted
(process protection only, not a safety function). The figure below shows the possible designs of locking devices.

Subject to change without notice\nReleasing the locking device using power can be performed as follows:
• Time
-control: In the case that a timer is used, the failure of this device shall not reduce the delay.
• Automatic: Only if there is no dangerous machine condition (e.g., due to standstill monitoring devices).
• Manual: The time between unlocking and the release of the protective device shall be greater than the time it
takes for the dangerous machine function to stop.
Mechanical and electrical integration of locking devices
The s
ame rules generally apply to locking devices as to interlocking devices. In relation to the principle of positive
opening, attention is to be paid to which contacts should be positively opened. Guard signaling contacts indicate
when the actuator has been withdrawn, that the guard is open. These contacts may be positive opening, but this is
not always required.
Auxiliary and escape release, emergency release
The r
isk assessment may show that in the case of a fault or in an emergency situation, measures are required
for freeing personnel trapped in the hazardous area. A distinction must be made between concepts for auxiliary
release (using a tool) and for emergency release or escape release (without a tool), as follows:
• Emergency release of a locking device
Possibility of manually unlocking the locking device without tools from outside the protected area in case of
emer g
ency. A locking device with emergency release may be required, for example, to free trapped persons or
to fight a fire.
• Au xiliary release of a locking device
Possibility of manually unlocking the locking device using a tool or a key from outside the protected area in
ca
se of malfunction. A locking device with auxiliary release is not suitable for emergency release or escape
release of the locking device.
• Esc ape release of a locking device
Possibility of manually unlocking the locking device without the use of tools within the protected area in order
to le
ave the area.
Locking force required
An es
sential criterion when selecting a locking device is the force required to hold the guard. Annex I of the
ISO 14119 standard specifies the maximum force that can be applied to the most commonly used movable
physical guards.

Trapped key systems
One w a
y of preventing unintentional starting is to use trapped key systems. Keys must be used to activate specific
functions and operating modes, see table 27, page 68 .
Figure 1: When a key is removed, a stop signal is generated and the dangerous state is stopped.
Figure 2: In the safe state (machine stopped), the safety locking device is unlocked and the door can be opened.
Figure 3: The service technician takes the key inside the plant. Inside, the inserted key enables the “setup mode”
operating mode. Dangerous machine movements can now be made at reduced speed (turning the robot sideways)
by means of an enabling switch. Automatic operation is disabled in this situation.
The key is then removed again, the service technician leaves the hazardous area, closes the door, and finally
reinserts the key into the adapter. The door is locked and automatic operation is now possible again.

Fault masking for series connection of interlocking devices with volt-free contacts
The ISO 14119 standard and the ISO TR 24119 technical report define, among other things, the requirements for
the lo
gical series connection of position switches. The risk of possible “fault masking” in the conventional series
connection of the safety switches limits the achievable performance level and makes such series connection
impermissible in some applications.
Fault masking can occur when switches with volt-free contacts are connected in series. Since the evaluation unit
only evaluates the signals of the complete series, fault detection can be prevented. The fault, e.g. a short-circuit or
cross-circuit, is either not detected at all or reset (masked) after detection as a result of the actuation of another3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

des
pite the presence of an isolated fault. The accumulation of masked faults may then lead to the loss of the
safety function.
Example for the development of fault masking
If it is assumed that, during foreseeable troubleshooting, one of the movable physical guards (e.g. protective
door, maint
enance flap) is operated by the machine operator and the fault is masked thereby, the corresponding
reduction in the diagnostic coverage DC (fault recognition rate) has to be taken into account. This may lead to the
performance level being reduced to PL d or PL c.
NOTE
For mor
e information, see the special information “ Safe series connection ” from SICK.
Electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE)
With electro-sensitive protective equipment (ESPE), in contrast to “guards”, protection is not based on the physical
separ a
tion of persons at risk from the hazard itself. Protection is achieved through temporal separation. As long
as there is somebody in a defined area, no dangerous machine functions are initiated, and such functions are
stopped if already underway. A certain amount of time, referred to as the “stopping/run-down time”, is required to
stop these functions.
The ESPE must detect the approach of a person to the hazardous area in a timely manner and depending on the
application, the presence of the person in the hazardous area.
The international standard IEC 61496-1 defines safety-related requirements for ESPE independent of their tech‐
nology or principle of operation.
What are the benefits of electro-sensitive protective equipment?
If an oper a
tor frequently or regularly has to access a machine and is therefore exposed to a hazard, the use of an
ESPE instead of (mechanical) physical guards (covers, safety fencing, etc.) is advantageous thanks to:
• Reduced access time (operator does not have to wait for the guard to open)
• Increased productivity (time savings when loading the machine)
• Improved workplace ergonomics (operator does not have to operate a physical guard)
In addition, operators and others alike are protected.
Against what hazards does electro-sensitive protective equipment not protect?
Sinc
e an electro-sensitive protective equipment does not represent a physical barrier, it is not able to protect
persons against emissions such as ejected machine parts, workpieces or chips, ionizing radiation, heat (thermal
radiation), noise, sprayed coolant and lubricant, etc. Similarly, ESPE cannot be used on machines on which long
stopping/run-down times require minimum distances that cannot be achieved.
In such cases, physical guards must be used.
ESPE technologies
Elec
tro-sensitive protective equipment can implement detection of persons through various principles: optical,
capacitive, ultrasound, microwaves (radar) and passive infrared detection.
In practice, optical protective devices have been proven over many years and in large numbers ( see figure 43,
page 70 ).3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\nOpto-electronic protective devices
The mos
t common electro-sensitive protective devices
are optoelectronic devices such as:
• Safety light curtains and safety light-beam sensors
(AOPD: active optoelectronic protective devices)
• Safety laser scanners (AOPDDR: active optoelec‐
tronic protective devices responsive to diffuse
reflection)
• Camera-based protective devices (VBPD: vision
based protective devices)
Figure 43: Examples of optoelectronic protective devices
NOTE
An opt oe
lectronic protective device can be used if the operator is not exposed to any danger of injury due to
ejected parts (e.g., splashes of molten material).
Safety light curtains and safety light-beam sensors (AOPD)
AOPDs are protective devices that use optoelectronic
tr
ansmission and reception elements to detect persons
in a defined two-dimensional area. A series of paral‐
lel light beams (normally infrared) transmitted from
the sender to the receiver form a protective field that
safeguards the hazardous area. Detection occurs when
an opaque object fully interrupts one or more beams.
The receiver signals the beam interruption by a signal
change (OFF state) to its output signal switching devi‐
ces (OSSDs).
These signals from the OSSDs are used to stop the
dangerous machine functions.
The international standard IEC 61496-2 defines safety
requirements for AOPDs.
Typical AOPDs include safety single-beam sensors,
safety multibeam sensors, and safety light curtains.
AOPDs with a detection capability of more than 40 mm
are called safety multibeam sensors. They are used
to protect access to hazardous areas ( see figure 44,
page 70 ).
AOPDs with a detection capability of 40 mm or less are
called safety light curtains and are used to safeguard
hazardous points directly ( see figure 45 ).
With both safety multibeam sensors and safety light
curtains, rather than all light beams being activated
at the same time, they are usually activated and deac‐
tivated in rapid sequence one after the other. This
increases resistance to interference from other sour‐
ces of light and increases their reliability accordingly.
On state-of-the-art AOPDs, there is automatic synchro‐
nization between sender and receiver through an opti‐

ev
aluated individually. This enables additional ESPE
functions to be implemented in addition to the pro‐
tective function itself ( "Additional functions of ESPE",
page 81 ).

tain
Safety laser scanners (AOPDDR)
AOPDDRs are protective devices that use optoelectronic sender and receiver elements to detect the reflection
of opt ic
al radiation generated by the protective device. This reflection is generated by an object in a predefined
two-dimensional area.
Detection is signaled by a signal change (OFF state) to its output signal switching devices (OSSDs). These signals
from the OSSDs are used to stop the dangerous machine functions.
A safety laser scanner is an optical sensor which monitors a hazardous area on a machine or vehicle by scanning
the area around it on a single plane with infrared light beams.
The safety laser scanner operates on the principle of
optic
al time-of-flight measurement. The scanner sends
very short light pulses (S) while an “electronic stop‐
watch” runs simultaneously. If the light strikes an
object, it is reflected and received by the scanner (R).
The scanner calculates the distance from the object
from the difference between the send and receive
times.
A uniformly rotating mirror (M) in the scanner deflects
the light pulses such that a sector of a circle is covered.
The scanner then determines the exact position of the
object from the measured distance and the angle of
rotation of the mirror.

Subject to change without notice\nThe area in which object detection leads to trigger‐
ing (
protective field) can be configured by the user
via a graphical user interface. Modern scanners sup‐
port simultaneous and separate monitoring of multiple
areas by evaluating fields simultaneously and by com‐
municating with the controller through multiple safe
cut-off paths. This feature can be used, for example,
to adapt the monitored area to the speed of a vehicle.
Safety laser scanners use individually emitted pulses
of light in precise directions and do not continuously
cover the area to be monitored. Resolutions (detection
capabilities) up to 20 mm are achieved through this
operating principle. With the active scanning principle,
safety laser scanners do not need external receivers
or reflectors. Safety laser scanners also have to be
able to reliably detect objects with extremely low reflec‐
tivity (e.g., black work clothing). The international stand‐
ard IEC 61496-3 states the safety requirements for
AOPDDRs.

Camera-based protective devices (VBPD)
VBPDs are camera-based protective devices and use
imag
e capturing and processing technologies for safety
detection of persons ( see figure 48 ).
Various principles can be used to detect persons,
including:
• Interruption of the light retro-reflected by a retro-
reflector
• Travel time measurement of the light reflected by
an object
• Monitoring of changes from background patterns
• Detection of persons based on human characteris‐
tics
The various technical specifications (TS) and technical
reports (TR) of the IEC 61496-4 series of standards
contain the requirements and characteristics of VBPDs.

Detection capability (resolution) of optoelectronic protective devices
The detection capability is defined as the limit for the sensor parameter that causes the electro-sensitive protec‐
ti
ve equipment (ESPE) to trigger.
In practice, this is about the size of the smallest object detected by the ESPE within the defined monitored area
(protective field).3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION
72 S P E C I A L  I N F O R M A T I O N  | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK
Subject to change without notice\nThe detection capability is specified by the manufacturer. In general, the detection capability is determined from
the sum of t
he beam separation and effective beam diameter. This ensures that an object of this size always
covers a light beam and is always detected regardless of its position in the protective field.
For safety laser scanners (AOPDDR), the detection capability is dependent of the distance to the object, the angle
between the individual beams of light (pulse), and the shape and size of the transmitted beam.
The reliability of the detection capability is determined by the type classification in the IEC 61496 series of
standards ( see table 28, page 75 ).
Preventing reflections from AOPDs
For AOPDs, the light beam is focused from the sender.
The aper
ture angle of the lens is reduced as far as
possible so that disturbance-free operation can even
be ensured in the event of minor alignment errors.
The same applies to the aperture angle of the receiver
(effective aperture angle according to IEC 61496-2).
But even for smaller aperture angles, there is the possi‐
bility for light beams from the sender to be deflected
from reflective surfaces, thus leading to a failure to
detect an object ( see figure 49 , see figure 50 ).
Therefore, all reflective surfaces and objects (e.g. mate‐
rial containers, reflective floors) have to maintain a min‐
imum distance a from the protective field of the system
(see table 28, page 75 ).
This minimum distance a depends on the distance
D between the sender and receiver (protective field
width). The minimum distance must be maintained on
all sides of the protective field.

mov
ement is stopped.

Subject to change without notice\nPreventing mutual interference from AOPDs
If several AOPDs are operated in close proximity to each
ot
her, the sender beams from a system (S1) can affect
the receiver of another system (R2). There is a danger
that the affected AOPD will lose its ability to provide
protection (see figure 51 ).
Assembly situations of this kind must be avoided. If
this is not possible, suitable measures must be taken
to prevent mutual interference (assembly of opaque
partitions or reversing the direction of transmission of a
system, for example).
Type 4 AOPDs either have to have suitable external
sender detection and change to a safe state (outputs
in OFF state) when affected or have technical means to
prevent interference. Beam coding is normally used so
that the receiver only responds to light beams from the
assigned (identically coded) sender ( see figure 52 ).

ESP
E (S2-R2) and the dangerous movement is not stopped.

Types of protection and required detection capability of the ESPE
This section describes the types of protection and which parts of the body should be detected by the ESPE.
Hazardous point protection with finger or hand detec‐
tion
H
azardous point protection is used to detect when
a person comes very close to the hazardous point.
This allows the smallest minimum distance to be imple‐
mented. This may be necessary for ergonomic oper‐
ation of the machine, e.g., for insertion work on a
press, or to keep the space requirement of the machine
low. Fingers/hands must therefore be detected, which
requires ESPE with a detection capability up to 40 mm
(ISO 13855). If a person can pass the detection zone of
the protective device, prevention of unexpected start-up

ing a ha
zardous area
Access protection is used to detect when a person
enters the hazardous area . Detection of the largest
body part (torso) is sufficient for this purpose. Access
protection is particularly suitable for protecting large
areas and areas with large access points . A person
who has passed the detection zone of the protective
device is no longer detected. Access protection there‐
fore always requires prevention of unexpected start-up.

Hazardous area protection: detection of the presence
of a per son in t
he hazardous area
Hazardous area protection is used to detect when a
person approaches or is present in the hazardous area .
This requires detection of the lower limbs  or torso.
Hazardous area protection is particularly suitable for
machines where, for example, the hazardous area  can‐
not be fully seen from the position of the reset push‐
button. Hazardous area protection does not require a
reset function if the detection zone cannot be exited in
the direction of the hazardous point. When entering the
hazardous area , the dangerous state of the machine is
stopped and starting is prevented.

Mobile hazardous area protection is used to detect
when a person approaches  or is present in the hazard‐
ous area  of a moving hazardous point. This requires
the detection of the lower limbs. The application may
require that people lying down are detected.
Mobile hazardous area protection is particularly suita‐
ble for autonomous vehicles (e.g., cranes and forklifts).

Automatic material passage using ESPE
The following safety functions can be integrated either in the logic unit or directly in suitable ESPE.
Automatic protective field switching
When lar
ge openings of machines are secured using
ESPE, changing the shape of the active protective field
can allow the passage of materials or packages with
different contours. This prevents persons accessing
the hazardous zone above or behind these materials.
Some types of ESPE (AOPD) allow preprogrammed
protective fields to be activated by external signals.
Instead of muting the entire protective device ( "Muting",
page 79 ), a suitable (vertical) protective field of the
ESPE can be activated during passage.
In addition, field switching may also be required if the
hazardous zones of machines change dynamically dur‐
ing machine operation, e.g., adapted exclusion zones
for industrial robots with different operating cycles or
for transfer trolleys when docking at a station.

Subject to change without notice\nMuting
The mut
ing function is used to temporarily deactivate
the protective function of a protective device. This is
necessary when material must be moved through the
protective field of the protective device without stopping
the work routine (hazardous state of the machine).
It can also be used effectively to optimize the work rou‐
tine if allowed by certain machine states (e.g., muting
the function of a safety light curtain during the non-haz‐
ardous upwards movement of a press die, making it
easier for the operator to remove workpieces).
Muting shall only be possible if the access to the haz‐
ardous point is blocked by the passing material. If it
is not possible to stand behind (or pass through) detec‐
tion areas, muting shall only be possible if the machine
functions still taking place are not dangerous (e.g., non-
dangerous upward stroke of a press). This status is
determined by muting sensors or signals.
For the muting function, great care is necessary when
selecting and positioning the muting sensors and con‐
troller signals used.
Figure 59: Muting function with safety light curtain and mut‐
ing sensor
s on a wrapping machine
The following conditions shall be met to implement a safe, standardized muting function:
• Durin
g muting, a safe state must be ensured by other means, therefore it shall not be possible to access the
hazardous area.
• Muting shall be automatic, i.e., not manual.
• Muting shall not be dependent on a single electrical signal.
• Muting shall not be entirely dependent on software signals.
• An invalid combination or sequence of muting signals shall not allow any muting state, and it shall be ensured
that the protective function is retained.
• The muting status shall end immediately after the material has passed through.
To improve the quality of differentiation, additional limits, interlockings, or signals can be used including:
• Direction of movement of the material (sequence of the muting signals)
• Limiting the muting time
• Material request by the machine control
• Operational status of the material handling elements (e.g., conveyor belt, roller conveyor)
• Material identification by additional properties (e.g., bar code)

Subject to change without notice\nSafety light curtains with entry/exit function
Active differentiation between person and machine
(entr
y/exit function) provides other way of moving mate‐
rial into a safeguarded area.
Horizontally arranged safety light curtains (AOPDs) are
used for this application. Each of their light beams can
be evaluated to distinguish the interruption pattern of
the material or material carrier (e.g., pallet) from that of
a person.
By using self-teaching dynamic blanking, as well as
other differentiation criteria such as direction of move‐
ment, speed, entry and exit in the protective field, etc.,
a safety-relevant distinction can be made. In this way,
undetected entry into the hazardous area by anyone
can be reliably prevented ( see figure 60).
Figure 60: Entry/exit function with horizontally installed safety
lig
ht curtain in a processing station on an automobile assem‐
bly line
Safety laser scanner with protective field switching
Another way of moving material into a protected area
is to ac
tively switch protective fields. As an alternative
to active protective field switching, it is possible to sep‐
arately evaluate simultaneous protective fields.
Safety laser scanners with vertical (or slightly tilted)
protective fields are generally used for this application.
The appropriate protective field, from a series of pre‐
programmed protective fields, is activated by corre‐
sponding signals from the machine controller and ade‐
quately positioned sensors. The contour of the protec‐
tive field is designed such that passage of the material
does not cause the protective device to activate, but
unmonitored areas are small enough to prevent unde‐
tected entry into the hazardous area by anyone ( see
figure 61).
Alternatively, protective field switching can be per‐
formed independently by the protective device without
the need for external sensors or signals (e.g., the
Safe Portal system solution from SICK, see figure 58,
page 78 ).

Subject to change without notice\nAdditional functions of ESPE
Blanking
For man
y AOPDs, configuration of the detection capabil‐
ity and/or protective field can be designed such that
the presence of one or more objects within a defined
section of the protective field does not trigger the safety
function (OFF state). Blanking can be used to allow
specific objects through the protective field, e.g., hose
for cooling lubricant, slide/carrier for workpieces ( see
figure 62).
For fixed blanking , the blanked area is precisely
defined in terms of its size and position. For floating
blanking , only the size of the blanked area is defined,
not its position in the protective field (see table 30).
If the object for which the blanking function in the pro‐
tective field had been configured, is no longer present
in the protective field, there will be a gap in the protec‐
tive field of the AOPD. In this case, the AOPD can trigger
the safety function (off state). This prevents undetected
approach of parts of the human body to the hazard
zone.
If the blanked area is not completely covered by the
blanked objects, a gap(s) is created in the protective
field. This/these must be closed by additional coverage
(see figure 62 ). Alternatively, the detection capability
resulting from the gap must be taken into account in
the minimum distance calculation.

ming pr

ed area, the resolution capability of ESPE is enlarged (deteriorates). Take the corresponding manufac‐
turer's specifications into account when calculating the minimum distance.

Subject to change without notice\nControl of a work operation using a protective device - PSDI mode
Using the protective device to trigger the machine function (controlling protective device) is described as PSDI
mode (P SDI – Pr
esence Sensing Device Initiation). This operating mode is advantageous if parts must be manually
loaded and unloaded cyclically.
Conforming to the standards, PSDI mode can only be executed with type 4 AOPDs and an effective resolution d
≤ 30 mm. In PSDI mode, the machine waits at a defined position for a specified number of interruptions by the
operator. The safety light curtain releases the dangerous movement again automatically after a specific number of
interruptions.
The ESPE has to be reset under the following conditions:
• When the machine starts
• On restart when the AOPD is interrupted within a dangerous movement
• If no PSDI was triggered within the specified PSDI time
It must be checked that no danger to the operator can arise during the work process. This limits the use of this
operating mode on machines in which there is no possibility for whole body access and it is not possible for the
operator to remain undetected between the protective field and the machine (presence detection).
Single break PSDI mode means that the AOPD initiates the machine function after the operator has completed one
intervention.
Double break PSDI mode means that the AOPD holds the machine function in the locked state after the operator's
first intervention (e.g., removal of a machined workpiece). Only after the operator has completed the second
intervention (e.g., feeding in of a blank) does the safety light curtain release the machine function again.
PSDI mode is often used on presses and stamps, but can also be used on other machines (e.g., rotating tables,
automatic assembly systems). When using PSDI mode, it must not be possible to stand behind the light curtain.
For presses, special conditions apply for PSDI mode.
Figure 63: Single break PSDI mode on an automatic assembly system with safety light curtain. During loading, the tool is at the
top point. Af
ter the operator leaves the protective field, the assembly process gets underway.

For P
SDI mode, the resolution of the AOPD shall be better than or equivalent to 30 mm (finger or hand detection).

Subject to change without notice\nDifferent protective fields
If protective fields with different shapes and/or dimen‐
sions ar e r
equired, corresponding requirements must
be met. These requirements relate to:
• the safety level of the safety-related parts of the
control system (SRP/CS)
• the avoidance of inadmissible conditions or inad‐
missible reconfigurations
• the activation, as well as the conditions for initiat‐
ing the automatic mode of the machine
• the state to be adopted when a fault is detected
• the necessary conditions for selecting the protec‐
tive field
• the installation and the organizational measures
When applications with simultaneous field evalua‐
tions are implemented, the number of switchovers is
reduced. The design is greatly simplified.

act
ive protective fields to allow passage of materials
into or out of a hazardous area:
• A “maximum” (largest) active protective field must
be configured in such a way as to prevent unde‐
tected access to hazardous areas when such
access is not blocked by the material.
• At least one of the switching signals must be gen‐
erated by a sensor that detects the position of the
material that is blocking access to the hazardous
area.
• Interruption and/or restoration of the power sup‐
ply to the sensors for material detection must not
result in the selection of an active protective field
that is not suitable for the machine state.
• The largest protective field is automatically acti‐
vated immediately after the material passes
through the active protective field.
• The automatic selection of the active protective
field must not be triggered by a ground fault or an
interruption in the signal lines or power supply to
the material detection sensor(s).

Subject to change without notice\nTwo-hand control device
The hazardous function is only triggered by deliberate
act
uation of two control switches (e.g., pushbuttons)
and ends as soon as one of the control switches is
no longer actuated. A two-hand control device can only
protect one operator at a time. If several operators
operate a machine, a separate two-hand control device
must be installed for each operator. There are several
types of two-hand control devices. The distinguishing
characteristics are listed below.
Figure 68: Example use of a two-hand device. This is
desi
gned to be movable (ergonomics). A spacer ring ensures
that the safety distance from the hazardous point is main‐
tained.
The following basic principles apply to all types:
• It shall be ensur ed t
hat both hands are used.
• Releasing one of the two controls stops the dangerous function.
• Accidental actuation must be prevented.
• It is not possible to simply bypass the two-hand control device.
• It must not be possible to take the two-hand control device into the hazardous area.
For type II and type III two-hand control devices, the following also apply:
• A new function may only be initiated after both controls have been released and then actuated.
For type III two-hand control devices, the following also apply:
• A function may only be initiated if both controls have been actuated synchronously within 0.5 seconds.
Sub-types with detailed control-related requirements are defined for type III two-hand control devices. The most
important sub-types are:
• Type III A: PLc or SIL 1
• Type III B: PLd or SIL 2 with HFT1
• Type III C: PLe or SIL 3 with HFT1

Subject to change without notice\nEnabling devices
Enabling devices are control switches which the opera‐
tor c
an use to purposely enable a machine function.
Generally, pushbuttons or foot switches are used as
enabling devices. Having proven their worth in indus‐
trial applications, 3-position enabling devices are to be
recommended.
• Position 1, not actuated
Execution of the function is not enabled
• Position 2, actuated in middle position
Execution of the function is enabled
• Position 3, actuated beyond the middle position
Execution of the function is not enabled and it
must stop immediately. Depending on the applica‐
tion, the triggering of a safety-related stop func‐
tion or an emergency stop function may also be
required.
During machine setup and maintenance, and if it is
necessary to observe production processes close up,
the functions of the protective devices intended for
normal operation can be temporarily disabled using
enabling devices. This is only permissible, however, in
conjunction with other measures that minimize the risk
(reduced force or speed, etc.).
Figure 69: Enabling device for setting up an automatic drilling
machine
NOTICE
The mac
hine start shall not be initiated solely by the actuation of an enabling device. Instead, movement is only
permitted as long as the enabling device is actuated.
The enabling device function must not be released while changing back from position 3 to position 2.
If enablin g de
vices are equipped with separate contacts in position 3, it is recommended to integrate them into a
safety-related stop function or the emergency stop function.
Protection against manipulation shall be considered when using enabling devices.
NOTE

uirements on enabling devices: IEC 60204-1
Foot switches
Foot switches are used to control work processes.
On cer t
ain machines (e.g., on presses, punches, bending and sheet metal working machines), foot switches may
only be used in safety functions under the following conditions:
• only for special operating modes
• always in conjunction with other technical protective measures (e.g., slow speed of a dangerous movement)
Foot switches used in this way must be designed as follows:
• A protective cover to protect against unintentional actuation
• A 3-position design similar to the enabling switch principle ( see "Enabling devices", page 86 )
• With manual reset on actuation of the actuator beyond the pressure point
• In such a way that after the dangerous machine function has stopped, the restart occurs only after the foot
switch is released and actuated again3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION
86 S P E C I A L  I N F O R M A T I O N  | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK

does not trigger an unintentional start (e.g., with at least one normally open contact and one normally closed
contact for evaluation)
• In appropriate numbers for all operators, so that a dangerous machine function can only be initiated and
maintained if all foot switches are actuated
Sensors for monitoring machine parameters
The risk assessment may show that certain machine parameters shall be monitored and detected during opera‐
tion (
see "Monitoring machine parameters", page 47 ).
Safe position monitoring
If, f
or safety reasons, parts of a machine are not
allowed to overrun or leave a certain position, position
switches or safety-related sensors should be used for
this purpose.
Electro-sensitive safety inductive position switches
are particularly suitable for this task ( see table 21,
page 63 ). They monitor a certain part of a robot’s axis
or a moving part of a machine for presence without the
need for a specific actuator, without wear, and with a
high enclosure rating.
Figure 70: Safe position monitoring for a lift on an automobile
produc
tion line
Monitoring of rotation, speed, overrun
Encoder
s or travel measurement systems are used to
detect and evaluate rotation, speed, and overrun.
The signals from encoders can be used in automated
guided vehicles to adapt the protective field size of
safety laser scanners to the speed at which the vehi‐
cles are moving.
Safe standstill or rotation evaluation modules monitor
the movement of drives using sensors or rotary encod‐
ers to generate a safe control signal at standstill or
on deviation from preset parameters. If safety-related
requirements are more stringent, either safety encod‐
ers or redundant encoders shall be used.
Another possibility is to monitor the voltage induced by
residual magnetism on a motor that is spinning down.

Subject to change without notice\nPressure-sensitive protective devices
In some applications, pressure sensitive protective devices such as pressure sensitive mats, pressure sensitive
rails or bum
pers may be useful. The principle of operation is based in the majority of cases on the elastic
deformation of a hollow body that ensures an internal signal generation (electromechanical or optical) which
triggers the safety function.
The standard electromechanical systems are available in various designs.
Correct mechanical layout and integration is imperative in all cases for an effective protective function. The detec‐
tion of children with body weights less than 20 kg is not considered in the product standards for pressure-sensitive
mats and floors.

In both variants, a short-circuit is produced when the protective device is activated.
In the c
ase of the 4-wire version, a circuit is short-circuited (a few ohms). In the
case of the resistance version, a change from a set resistance (a few kOhms) is
detected. These designs require more complex evaluation.This design is more universal and offers
more ad
vantages. As on a safety switch,
a switch contact is opened on activation
of the protective device. A short-circuit
between the cables can be prevented by
using a special cable layout.

Complementary protective measures
If necessary, provision must be made for further protective measures which are neither inherently safe designs or
tec
hnical precautionary measures.
These might include:
• Emergency stop devices
• Measures to free and rescue persons who have become trapped
• Measures for isolating and dissipating energy
(see "Power supply connection", page 31  and see "Mains disconnection device", page 33 )
• Preventive measures for easy and safe handling of machines and heavy parts
• Measures for safe access to machinery3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\nIf these complementary measures are dependent upon the correct function of the corresponding control compo‐
nent s
, then they are safety functions. The requirements on functional safety must be met for these measures. ( see
"Application of reset and restart", page 110 ).
Emergency operation
To prevent impending hazards to persons, damage to
machine
s or production processes, or to minimize exist‐
ing ones, functions must be provided for such emergen‐
cies. These functions, which cause machine functions
to stop (emergency stop) or electrical power to be dis‐
connected (emergency switching off) in an emergency,
are complementary protective measures for hazards on
machines. They do not replace the use of inherently
safer design or protective devices.

Emergency stop (ISO 13850)
In the e
vent of an emergency, not only shall all hazardous machine functions be ceased, but the energy from all
energy sources which pose a hazard shall be dissipated. This procedure is known as emergency stopping. Every
machine must be equipped with at least one emergency stop function, except:
• Machines for which an emergency stop would not reduce the risk
• Hand-held and hand-guided machines
The emergency stop function must be triggered by a single action of a person. The following fundamental
requirements apply to the emergency stop function and its devices in accordance with ISO 13850:
• The actuators of emergency stop control switches must be easily accessible.
• The emergency stop function must end the dangerous state in a suitable manner as quickly as possible
without creating additional risks.
• The emergency stop function must take priority over all other functions and commands in all operating
modes.
• The emergency stop function must not impair the effectiveness of other safety functions.
• Resetting the emergency stop control switches must not initiate a restart.
• The principle of direct mechanical positive actuation with mechanical interlocking function must be applied
(referred to as a latching function in IEC 60947-5-1).
• When an emergency stop control switch is actuated, a stop command must be triggered, regardless of the
effectiveness of the mechanical interlock function or latching function.
• The emergency stop function must conform to stop category 0 or 1 ( see "Stopping", page 35 ).
• The emergency stop function must be designed in such a way that decisions to trigger it do not require the
relevant person to think about the consequences (e.g., economic losses).3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\nReset
If an emer g
ency stop device is actuated, devices triggered by this action must remain in the off state until the
device has been reset. Actuated emergency stop devices must be reset by hand locally. The reset must only
prepare the machine to be put back into operation ( see "Application of reset and restart", page 110 ).
The operating instructions of the machine must provide information that after actuation and before resetting the
control switch, the machine must be checked to determine the reason for the actuation. If the emergency stop
control switch is operated by ropes or wires, the instructions must include checking the entire length of the ropes
or wires.
In the case of emergency stop control switches in porta‐
ble oper a
tor panels, resetting the emergency stop com‐
mand must only be possible after the actuated emer‐
gency stop control switch has been unlocked.
If the area of operation of the machine is not fully visi‐
ble (see figure 73, page 90 ), an additional reset must
be carried out by one or more reset buttons to avoid the
risk of an unexpected start-up. This is to ensure that no
persons are present in a danger zone or that persons in
need of assistance remain undetected.
Figure 73: Example of an area of operation that is not fully
visible
Emer
gency stop equipment
The emer
gency stop function is a “safety function” and therefore the requirements of functional safety must be
met (ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061).
The required reliability of the safety function (PL or SIL) should correspond to the purpose of the emergency stop
function. The minimum requirement, however, is PL c according to ISO 13850 or SIL1 according to IEC 62061.
The hydraulic and pneumatic equipment that performs an emergency stop function must comply with the require‐
ments of ISO 4413 or ISO 4414.
The electrical equipment for emergency stop functions must meet the requirements of IEC 60204-1. The contacts
on the electrical control switches must be positive opening normally closed contacts.
The actuators must be red. The background must be yellow, if present and technically possible. The following types
of control device may be used:
• Sw itches actuated with mushroom head pushbuttons
• Switches actuated with wires, ropes, or rails
• Foot switches without protective cover (only for emergency stop and only if other solutions cannot be used)
• Mains disconnecting devices operated by handles according to IEC 60204-13C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

void confusion between actuation (e.g., pressing an actuator) and release (e.g., turning an actuator), the
marking for release must be the same or approximately the same color as the actuator.
Emergency stop control switches must be mounted in such a way that their actuation cannot be prevented by
simple means or blocked unintentionally. Actuating surfaces with locks for resetting should be avoided. If such
emergency stop control switches are used, the operating instructions for the machine must provide information
on their correct usage. In particular, attention should be drawn to the possibility of injury if actuated with a key
inserted.
Area of operation of the emergency stop function
The ar
ea of operation of the emergency stop function must always include the complete machine. If this creates
additional hazards or has an unnecessary impact on production, the machine can be divided into several areas of
operation of the emergency stop function. Areas of operation may include parts of a machine, a single machine, or
a group of machines. Different areas of operation may overlap.
A division into areas of operation should take into account the following:
a) the visible areas resulting from the machine design
b) the ability to recognize dangerous situations (visibility, audibility, etc.)
c) all safety-relevant consequences for other parts of the machine or other machines
d) the foreseeable hazard exposures
e) all possible hazards in the area of operation
The different areas of operation must be defined and marked so that the emergency stop control switches
can be easily associated with the appropriate areas. The actuation of an emergency stop device for one area
of operation must not prevent the triggering of an emergency stop function in another area of operation. The3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\noperating instructions of the machine must contain information on the area(s) of operation of the emergency stop
contr
ol switches. Emergency stop control switches with different areas of operation should, as far as technically
possible, not be arranged next to each other or located close to each other.
Position of emergency stop control switches
Emerg
ency stop control switches must be provided at
each operator panel unless the risk assessment indi‐
cates that it is not required. Emergency stop control
switches must also be located in other places if the risk
assessment indicates this (e.g., at entry and exit points
or loading and unloading points).
Emergency stop control switches that are to be oper‐
ated by hand must be installed at a height between
0.6 and 1.7 m above the access level (reference level).
Foot switches for emergency stop functions must be
permanently mounted at the access level.
Figure 76: Distributed emergency stop control switches on a
pack
aging system
Avoiding unintentional triggering
Unint
entional triggering of emergency stop control switches must be avoided as far as possible without hindering
intentional triggering. This is more likely to be achieved by layout than by design measures:
• Locating the emergency stop device away from foreseeably busy areas
• Mounting the emergency stop device in a recessed surface of the enclosing operator panel
• Selecting a suitable type of emergency stop device
• Selecting the appropriate size and shape of the emergency stop device
The use of a protective collar around the emergency stop device should be avoided. An exception exists if
unintentional actuation must be prevented and other measures are not practicable.
Protective collars must not have any sharp corners or edges or rough surfaces and must not hinder or prevent
operation with the palm of the hand. This applies from any foreseeable position of the machine operator or other
persons who must be able to operate it (nearby operator or work stations).
Emergency stop control switches in portable operator panels
When emer
gency stop control switches are installed in portable operator panels, measures must be used to avoid
confusion between active and non-active emergency stop control switches. This also applies to operator panels
where the emergency stop commands are transmitted via plug connections on the controller. At least one of the
following measures must be used:
• Identification of the active emergency stop control switches through a color change by means of illumination
• Covering the inactive emergency stop control switches, if possible automatically
• Provision of suitable storage for the inactive operator panels
Emergency switching off (switching off in an emergency situation - IEC 60204-1)
Pro
vision should be made for emergency switching off if there is a possibility of hazards or damage caused by
electrical energy. The incoming electrical energy supply should be switched off by electromechanical switching
devices.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Positioning and sizing of protective devices
It must be ensured that the dangerous state can be eliminated in good time before the hazardous point is reached.
This r
equires the protective device to be positioned at the required minimum distance from the hazardous point.
The necessary minimum distance also depends on the properties of the protective device. This can also affect the
selection of the optimal protective device.

The consideration of the minimum safety distance applies to ESPEs with two-dimensional protective fields, e.g.,
lig
ht curtains, single-beam photoelectric safety switches (AOPD), laser scanners (AOPDDR), or two-dimensional
camera systems. There are three types of approach.
After the stop initiating ESPE has been selected, the required minimum distance between the ESPE’s protective
field and the nearest hazardous point is to be calculated.
The following parameters shall be taken into account:
• Stopping time of the machine
• Response time of the safety-related control system
• Response time of the protective device (ESPE)
• Supplements according to the resolution capability of the ESPE, the protective field height, and/or the type of
approach as well as the possibility of bypassing the protective field by reaching around, over or under it ( see
table 40, page 103 ).
If the minimum distance to the hazardous area is too large and unacceptable from an ergonomic viewpoint, either
the overall stopping time of the machine must be reduced or an ESPE with a better detection capability (smaller
resolution) chosen. Risks due to a person possibly remaining undetected between the protective field of the ESPE
and the hazardous point must be avoided by taking suitable measures against unexpected start-up:
• Restart interlocks that require a manual reset
• Additional device for detecting persons in the hazardous area ( see table 40, page 103 )
NOTE

alculation of the minimum distance S for ESPE is described in the ISO 13855 standard (type-B standard).
General calculation formula

Protective devices that can be reached over
Dependin
g on the height and position of the protective field of an ESPE, the shape of the machine, and other
factors, the protective field of an ESPE can be reached over to gain access to hazardous points before the
hazardous machine functions have ceased and the intended protection is thereby not provided. The figure shows
an example comparing an ESPE that cannot be reached over and an ESPE that can be reached over.

ESPE cannot be reached over ESPE can be reached over
If access to the hazardous area by reaching over a protective field cannot be prevented, the height of the
pro
tective field and minimum distance of the ESPE must be determined. This is done by comparing the calculated
values based on the possible detection of limbs or body parts with the values resulting from possibly reaching
over the protective field. The higher value of this comparison shall be applied. This comparison is to be carried out
according to ISO 13855, Section 6.5.
If it is not possible to reach over the protective field of the ESPE, C is determined by the detection capability
(re
solution) of the ESPE and is referred to as C RT (reach through). If it is possible to reach over the protective field
of the ESPE, C is determined by the height of the protective field and is referred to as C RO (reach over).3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

This t
ype of protection is recommended for large sys‐
tems that are accessible from the floor. In this special
case, starting of the machine (“preventing start” safety
function) must be prevented while there is an opera‐
tor inside. This is a secondary protective device which
detects the presence of persons in the hazardous area
and simultaneously prevents the machine switching
to the dangerous state. In addition to the ESPE for
presence detection, there shall be a primary protective
measure for the “initiating a stop” safety function, e.g.,
in the form of another ESPE or a locked, movable physi‐
cal guard.
The minimum distance shall be calculated in this case
for the main protective device (e.g., a vertical light cur‐
tain that has the task of stopping the machine).

ety function pos. 1, initiating a stop and safety function
pos. 2, preventing start (presence detection)
Special case 3: ESPE applications on autonomous
ve
hicles
If the dangerous state is as a result of a collision with
an autonomous vehicle, the determination of the mini‐
mum distance is generally based only on the speed the
vehicle is traveling and not on the approach speed of
the person. It is assumed that the person recognizes
the approaching vehicle (vehicle with protective device)
and stops or moves away.
Figure 80: Hazardous area protection on an autonomous
ve
hicle with safety laser scanners
The minimum distance needs to be set to a length that is sufficient to stop the vehicle safely. The minimum
dist
ance corresponds to the braking distance of the vehicle. An exact calculation of the braking distance is not
possible, as it depends on several factors, e.g., friction between the tire and ground, total weight incl. load, braking
force, etc.
It is therefore recommended to first calculate the minimum distance and validate (confirm) the result by testing.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\nFor the calculation, the braking deceleration of the vehicle (a) at nominal load, maximum operating speed (v 0)
and under t he int
ended operating conditions must be known or determined. The braking distance (S B) is then
calculated as follows:
SB=v02

Safety supplements may be necessary depending on the application and the technology used. The calculated
value mus
t be validated by two tests:
1. For detecting a lying person
A test body with a diameter of 200 mm and a
leng
th of 600 mm must be used. The test body is
placed horizontally in a fixed position on the left, in
the middle, and on the right of the vehicle path to
be protected and orthogonal (perpendicular) to the
vehicle path.

cle f
or testing the detection of a person lying down
2. For detecting a standing person
A test body with a diameter of 70 mm and a
leng
th of 400 mm must be used. The test body is
placed vertically and completely in a fixed position
anywhere on the vehicle path to be protected.

Subject to change without notice\n3. Validation
The vehicle must be loaded with the nominal load and approach the test body at the maximum operating
speed
. The vehicle must stop in time, therefore either not touch the test body or, if contact occurs, the force
applied to the (1) horizontal test body must not exceed 750 N and to the (2) vertical test body must not
exceed 250 N.
This is the current standardized method to be used for the protection of autonomous vehicles in the industrial
sect
or (ISO 3691-4).
The method can also be used for the non-industrial sector, but it is important to consider the following:
• It cannot always be assumed that persons will never approach the moving vehicle. Both speeds (person and
vehicle) may therefore need to be considered accordingly.
• The maximum permissible forces in the event of contact with children or elderly people are much lower than
those specified.
• The bodily dimensions of children cannot be simulated using the specified test bodies. In this case, the
dimensions of the test bodies should be taken from the relevant literature.
Special case 4: Stationary application of an onboard ESPE
The w
ay in which some machines function requires that operators are located very close to the hazardous area.
On press brakes, small pieces of plate must be held very close to the bending edge. Moving systems that
form a protective field around the tool openings have proven to be practical protective devices. Because the
hand approach speed of the operator is not taken into account in such applications, the general formula is not
applicable.
The requirements to be met by the resolution are very high and reflections on metal surfaces shall be prevented.
For this reason, focused laser systems with image-based evaluation are used. This type of protection is defined in
the type-C standards in conjunction with other measures (e.g., 3-pedal foot switch, automatic stop time measure‐
ment, requirement to wear gloves, etc.).

now-how and equipment are required to measure the stopping/run-down time and the required minimum
distance. SICK offers these measurements as a service.
Approaches to calculating the minimum distance
Solution approach 1: Perpendicular approach – hazardous point protection with presence detection
The c
alculation results in a minimum distance of S = 320 mm ( see figure 83 ). By using a safety light curtain with
the best possible resolution (14 mm), this is already the optimal minimum distance.
Two AOPDs are used to ensure that the person is detected everywhere in the hazardous area:
• a vertical AOPD positioned according to the calculated minimum distance (vertical approach) - for the safety
function: initiating a stop
• a horizontal AOPD to eliminate the risk of standing behind - for the safety function: preventing an unexpected
start-up3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

A hor i
zontal AOPD is used. The following figure shows a horizontally arranged AOPD and the calculation of the
minimum distance S. If the installation height of the AOPD is increased to 300 mm, the minimum distance is
reduced. For this height, an AOPD with a resolution less than or equal to 80 mm can be used. It must not be
possible, however, to access the hazardous area beneath the AOPD (evaluate the risk of crawling beneath). This
type of safeguarding is also often implemented using AOPDDR (laser scanners). However, supplements have to be
added for these devices for technology-related reasons.

Required protective field size/height of the ESPE
As a general rule, the following faults must be excluded when assembling protective devices:
• It shall onl y be pos
sible to reach the hazardous point through the protective field.
• In particular, it shall not be possible to reach hazardous points by reaching over/under/around.
• If it is possible to stand behind protective devices, additional measures to prevent an unexpected startup are
required (e.g., restart interlock, secondary protective device).
Once the minimum distance between protective field and the nearest hazardous point has been calculated, the
protective field height required must be determined in a further step. This ensures the hazardous point cannot be
reached by reaching over.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Increase minimum distance (height of top edge prescribed)
If the top edge of the protective field b is pr e scribed
for an already existing product, the minimum distance
must be increased. This is done by determining the
height of the hazardous area a and the height of the
top edge of the protective field b.
The result of the intersection represents the intrusion
distance C RO. Once C RO and C RT have been determined,
the larger of the two values is used to calculate the
minimum distance.

1. D
etermine the height of the hazardous point a and find the equivalent or next highest value in the left-hand
column.
2. Calculate the supplement C RT determined by the resolution using the familiar formulas for perpendicular
approach:
°ESPE, resolution d ≤ 40 mm: C RT = 8 × (d – 14)
°ESPE, resolution d > 40 mm: C RT = 850 mm
3. In the row defined by a, find the last column in which the shortest additional horizontal distance C is less than
or equal to the calculated supplement C RT determined by the resolution.
4. Read the resulting height b of the top edge of the protective field from the bottom row of the column
determined in Step 2.

Minimum distance for interlocked physical guards
For interlocked physical guards that initiate a stop, a minimum distance must also be observed analogous to the
procedur
e for ESPE. Alternatively, locks with interlocking mechanisms may be used to prevent access until the
hazard is no longer present.
Description of the parameters:
• S: Minimum dis t
ance in millimeters, measured
from the nearest hazardous point to the nearest
door opening point.
• K: Parameter in millimeters per second, derived
from the data for the approach speeds of the body
or parts of the body, usually 1,600 mm/s.
• T: Stopping/run-down time for the entire system in
seconds.
• C: Safety distance (s r, see table 44). This is nec‐
essary if it is possible to insert fingers or hands
through the opening and towards the hazard zone
before a stop signal is generated.

Similar to the procedure for ESPE, the same procedure is also to be used for physical guards. Different calculation

To prevent crawling beneath physical guards, it is normally sufficient if the guards start at 180 mm above the
reference level.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

If the hei
ght of the physical guard is to be 1,600 mm, the safety distance must be increased to at
least 800 mm.
Proceed as follows to determine the required height of the top edge of the physical guard for this safety distance:
1. D
etermine the height of the hazardous point a and find the value in the left-hand column, e.g., 1,000 mm.
2. In this row, find the first column in which the horizontal distance C is less than the safety distance calculated,
e.g., the first field with the value “0”.
3. Read the resulting height b for the physical guard in the bottom row, e.g., 1,800 mm.

Application of reset and restart
If a protective device triggers a stop command, the stop status must be maintained until a safe state for a restart
exis
ts. The risk assessment may indicate that the stop status must only be ended by means of a manual, separate
and intentional reset. The machine can be restarted in a further step.
The reset must be performed using a special operated device. The operated device must be able to withstand the
foreseeable stresses and must be used properly to prevent unintentional actuation (touch panels may be unsuita‐
ble). Furthermore, the device must be installed in a safe location outside the hazardous area. The hazardous area
must be fully visible from this location to ensure that no person is in the hazardous area.
The signal from the operated device must enable the controller to issue a separate start command for restarting.
The signal processing must ensure that the restart can only take place if all safety functions and protective
devices are functional.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\nISO 13849-1 (section 5.2.2) therefore requires that
re
setting may only occur by releasing the command
device from its actuated (ON) position and that the
signal processing should detect the falling signal edge
of the command device. This means that the acknowl‐
edgment must only occur by releasing the actuating
element from its actuated (ON) position.
Figure 92: The position of the reset pushbutton allows a full

w of the hazardous area when resetting the protective
device.
Manual resetting is a safety function and must be implemented accordingly, e.g., by applying the ISO 13849-1 or
IEC 62061 s
tandards.
The signal (on actuation) of the reset device is part of the safety function. One of the following measures must
therefore be implemented:
• The signal must be discretely wired to the safety-related logic unit.
• The signal must be transmitted via a safety-related bus system.
The reset shall not initiate any movement or hazardous situation. Instead, the machine control system shall only
accept a separate start command after the reset.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

the ha

Figure 94: Circuit design for a safety-related logic unit with contactors
Using indi
vidual auxiliary contactors with positively guided contacts, it is possible to design control functions
with any level of complexity. Redundancy and monitoring by positively guided contacts are features of this safety
principle. Wiring provides the logical operators.
Function:  If the contactors K1 and K2 are de-energized, on pressing S1 the K3 contactor is energized and
remains energized. If no object is detected in the active protective field, the outputs OSSD1 and OSSD2 are
conducting voltage. The contactors K1 and K2 are energized by the normally open contacts on K3 and latch. K3
is de-energized by releasing S1. Only then are the output circuits closed. On detection of an object in the active
protective field, the K1 and K2 contactors are de-energized by the OSSD1 and OSSD2 outputs.

Subject to change without notice\nSafety relays combine one or more safety functions in one housing. They generally also have automatic monitoring
func
tions. The cut-off paths can be set up based on contact or using semiconductors. They can also have signaling
contacts.
Building more complex safety applications is simplified by integrating multiple functions into one device. The
certified safety relay also reduces the time and effort involved in validating the safety functions. In safety relays,
semiconductor elements can perform the task of the electromechanical switching elements instead of relays.
Using measures to detect faults such as the sampling of dynamic signals or measures to control faults such
as multiple channel signal processing, purely electronic control systems can achieve the necessary degree of
reliability.
Logic unit with software-based components
Similar t
o automation technology, safety technology has developed from hard-wired auxiliary contactors through
safety relays (some with configurable safety logic for which parameters can be set) to complex fail-safe PLCs. The
concept of “proven components” and “proven safety principles” must be transferred to electrical and programma‐
ble electronic systems.
The logical operators for the safety function are implemented in the software. Software is to be differentiated from
firmware — developed and certified by the manufacturer of the control device — and the actual safety application,
which is developed by the machine manufacturer using the functionality supported by the firmware.
The choice and adjustment of the functions of logic units is offered in different levels of flexibility:
• Parameterization
• Configuration
• Programming

lection of properties from a defined pool of functionality by selector switch/software parameters at the

Reliable data transmission
Bus s y
stems are used to transmit signals between
the control system and sensors or power-controlling ele‐
ments on the machine. Bus systems are also respon‐
sible for the transmission of states between different
parts of control systems. A bus system makes wiring
easier and as a result reduces the possible errors. It
is reasonable to use bus systems already used in the
market for safety-related applications.
An examination of the hardware and software errors
that arise in transmission systems shows that these
errors lead to the following transmission errors in bus
systems:
• Repetition
• Loss
• Insertion
• Wrong sequence
• Corruption
• Data delay
Transmission errors can be avoided using various
measures in the higher-level control system, e.g., by
sequential numbering of the safety-related telegrams
or a time expectation for incoming telegrams with
acknowledgment. Protocol extensions based on the
field-bus used include such measures.
In the ISO/OSI layer model, they act over the transport
layer and, therefore, use the field-bus with all its com‐
ponents as a “black channel”, without modification.
Examples of established safe bus systems are:
• Actuator Sensor Interface Safety at Work
• DeviceNet CIP Safety™
• PROFIsafe

Subject to change without notice\nSoftware specification
To pr
event the occurrence of a dangerous state, soft‐
ware-based logic units in particular shall be designed
so that they can be relied upon to prevent errors in the
logic. To detect systematic errors, a thorough system‐
atic check should be made by someone other than the
designer and thus the principle of counter-checking by
a second person applied.
A simple way of implementing this specification is the
so-called design matrix . Here certain combinations of
safety-related input signals for specific cases (e.g.,
“position lost”, or “robot left”) are combined. These
cases shall act on the machine functions via the safety-
related outputs in accordance with the requirements of
the safety function. This simple method is also used by
SICK during the design of application software.
It is advisable to have this reviewed by all involved in
the project.
In the case of programs that are poorly documented
and unstructured, errors occur during subsequent mod‐
ifications; in particular, there is a risk of unknown
dependencies or side effects, as they are often referred
to. When the software is developed externally, good
specifications and program documentation are very
effective in avoiding faults.

witch off/power shutdown: ISO 13849-2 (type-B standard)
Contactors
Elec
tromechanical contactors are the most commonly used type of power control element. One or more contactors
can form a safety function subsystem by combining special selection criteria, wiring, and technical measures. By
protecting the contacts against overcurrent and short-circuits, over-sizing (normally by a factor of 2) and other
measures, a contactor is considered a proven component. To be able to perform diagnostics on contactors for
safety functions, unambiguous feedback of the output state is necessary (EDM = external device monitoring). This
requirement can be met using a contactor with positively guided contacts. The contacts are positively guided when
the contacts in a set of contacts are mechanically linked in such a way that normally open contacts and normally
closed contacts can never be closed simultaneously during at any point during the intended mission time.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION
118 S P E C I A L  I N F O R M A T I O N  | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK
Subject to change without notice\nThe term “positively guided contacts” refers primarily
to au
xiliary contactors and auxiliary contacts. A defined
distance between the contacts of at least 0.5 mm at
the normally closed contact must be ensured even in
the event of a fault (welded N/O contact). Since on
contactors with low switching capacity (< 4 kW) there
is essentially no difference between the main contact
elements and the auxiliary contact elements, it is also
possible to use the term “positively guided contacts” to
refer to those small contactors.
On larger contactors, what are known as “mirror con‐
tacts” are used: While a main contact on a contactor
is closed, no mirror contact (auxiliary normally closed
contact) is allowed to be closed. A typical application
for mirror contacts is the highly reliable monitoring of
the output state of a contactor in control circuits on
machines.

Suppressor elements
Induc t
ances such as coils on valves or contactors must be equipped with a suppressor to limit transient voltage
spikes on shutdown. In this way the switching element is protected against overload (in particular against overvolt‐
age on particularly sensitive semiconductors). As a rule, such circuits have an effect on the release delay and,
therefore, on the required minimum distance of the protective device ( see "Approaches to calculating the minimum
distance", page 100 ). A simple diode for arc suppression can result in a release (switch to OFF) time up to 14
times longer.

mov
ement, for example.

tec
hnical design and safety function. Braking systems and holding systems are also to be taken into account on
axes subject to gravity.
The actual motor is not part of the assessment.
Servo amplifiers and frequency inverters
In dr i
ve technology, three-phase motors with frequency inverters have largely replaced DC drives. The inverter
generates an output voltage of variable frequency and amplitude from the fixed three-phase mains. Depending on
design, regulated rectifiers can feed the energy absorbed by the intermediate circuit during braking back to the
mains.
The rectifier converts the electrical power supplied from the mains and feeds it to the DC intermediate circuit. To
perform the required control function, the inverter forms a suitable revolving field for the motor using pulse-width
modulation and semiconductor switches. The usual switching frequencies are between 4 kHz and 12 kHz.

To limit t

The contribution of the drive to the safety function can be implemented in various ways:

onnecting the supply of power, e.g., using a mains contactor 1 or a motor contactor 5
• By external monitoring circuits, e.g., by monitoring an encoder
• By safety sub-functions integrated directly in the drive ( "Safety sub-functions integrated in the drive",

When usin
g inverters, the energy stored in the intermediate circuit's capacitors and the energy produced by a
regenerative braking process must be taken into account in the risk assessment.
During the consideration of the residual travel, it is to be assumed that the motion control system does not
initiate a brake ramp. After shutdown, the drive continues running at more or less the same speed, depending
on the friction (stop category 0). The use of a brake ramp by changing the setpoint and/or controller enable and
subsequent shutdown of the contactor or the pulse inhibit (stop category 1) can reduce the braking distance.

Speed detection with external monitoring units
To monit
or the drive, external monitoring units require various signals providing information about the current
movement parameters. In this case the signal sources are sensors and encoders. These must either be designed
as safe sensors or with redundancy, depending on the required safety level PL or SIL.
Alternatively, standstill monitoring can also be implemented by reading back the voltage induced by the motor
coasting down. This technique also functions with speed-controlled drives.
Safety sub-functions integrated in the drive
Saf
ety functions are implemented by safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS). They include the sub-func‐
tions of measuring (sensor), processing (logic unit), and switching or actuation (power control element). In this
context, safety-related functions integrated in the drive are to be considered safety sub-functions.
They are generally divided into two groups:
• Safety-related stopping and braking functions: These functions are used to stop the drive safely (e.g., safe
stop).
• Safe monitoring functions: These functions are used for the safe monitoring of the drive during operation
(e.g., safely reduced speed).
In general, the drive monitoring functions necessary depend on the application. Boundary conditions include
parameters such as the necessary braking distance, the presence of kinetic energy, etc.
The shutdown response varies depending on the selected safety sub-function. For example, on a stop request,
safe torque off (STO) results in uncontrolled coasting down of the movement. During a safe stop (SS1 or SS2),
controlled retardation is initiated. A combination of element functions may also need to be implemented as a
suitable measure.
Possible interfaces for the implementation of safety sub-functions integrated directly in the drive are:
• Discrete 24-V signals
• Control communication (channel 1)/24 V discrete (channel 2)
• Safe communication systems (field-bus systems/network interface)
In control communication, a setpoint for speed or position is transmitted from the standard controller to the drive;
via a non-safety fieldbus or a network.
The majority of safety sub-functions for variable speed drives available today are specified in the harmonized
standard IEC 61800-5-2 “Adjustable speed electrical power drive systems”, Part 5-2 “Safety requirements –
Functional safety”. Drives that meet this standard can be used as safety-related parts of a control system in
accordance with ISO 13849-1 or IEC 62061.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Fluid control systems
Valves
All val
ves contain moving switching elements (piston slide, plunger, seat, etc.) which, due to their function, are
subject to wear.
The most frequent causes of the safety-related failure of valves are:3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION
122 S P E C I A L  I N F O R M A T I O N  | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK
Subject to change without notice\n• Failur e of functional elements of the valve (reset function, switching function, sealing function)
• Contamination of the fluid
Contamination constitutes unintended use and generally leads to malfunctions. A general rule for all valves
is that contamination leads to premature wear, thus negating the essential prerequisites used for design and
dimensioning based on a defined probability of failure.
The mechanical springs for the reset function used in monostable valves are generally designed for high endur‐
ance and can be considered proven in accordance with ISO 13849-2. However, exclusion of failure in the event of
the springs breaking is not possible.
An important differentiating factor between the valves is the design of the moving switching element inside the
valve.
The failure mode for each valve is essentially determined by its design. Poppet valves might leak, but in piston
valves, the piston slide might jam.
With a poppet valve, the switching function is effected by the moving switching element (valve plate), which
changes position relative to a seat inside the housing. This design enables large cross-sections to be released with
short strokes. The risk of leaks can be excluded with an appropriate design.
In the case of piston valves, the valve body closes or opens the flow path by moving over a bore or circumferential
groove. The changes in the cross-section of the piston slide relative to the changes in cross-section inside the
housing affect volume flow and are known as control edges. An essential feature of this valve design worthy of
note is what is known as the lap. The lap is the longitudinal distance between the stationary and moving control
edges of the slide valve. Due to the gap between the piston and the housing bore required for hard-sealing valves,
a leak will occur in the event of a pressure differential.
Safety-related design principles
For t
he safety-related use of valves, feedback of the valve position may be necessary.
Here various techniques are used:
• Reed switches that are actuated by a magnet fixed into the moving valve body
• Inductive proximity switches that are actuated directly by the moving switching element of the valve
• Analog position detection of the moving switching element of the valve
• Pressure measurement downstream of the valve
In the case of electromagnetically actuated valves, like a contactor, the solenoid requires a suppressor. In terms of
safety as defined in ISO 13849, valves are defined as power control elements. The failure of drives/work elements
must also be considered according to the possible repercussions.

ast majority of failures of fluid control systems are due to disturbances related to contamination of the
related fluid. The two main causes are:3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

cloths, basic contamination)
• Contamination that occurs during operation = operating contamination (e.g., ambient contamination, compo‐
nent abrasion)
These contaminations must be reduced to an acceptable degree with the aid of filters.
For this purpose, a filter concept must be developed that defines the filter principle and its installation location.
The filter concept must be designed so that it is able to retain in the filter the contamination added to the entire
system in such a way that the required purity is maintained throughout the operating time.

Safety-related pneumatics
Electropneumatic control systems use a logic unit to implement safety functions. The logic unit provides electrical
signals t
hat act on the drive/actuators via a combination of a number of valves; these valves act as power
control elements. Typical safety-related functions can be allocated to a machine’s operating modes as safety
sub-functions. Purely pneumatic control systems exist alongside electropneumatic control systems. The advantage
of these solutions is that the deterministic nature of the pneumatics makes it relatively easy to set up safety
sub-functions that are purely pneumatic.3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Summary: Designing the safety function
General
• De
velop a concept for the required safety functions. In this concept, consider the characteristics of the
machine, design, surroundings, protective device, and also take into account human characteristics.
• Design appropriate safety functions for the required safety level. Safety functions comprise sensor, logic, and
power control element subsystems.
• Determine the safety level of each subsystem based on safety aspects (structure, reliability, diagnostics,
resistance, process conditions).
Properties and application of protective devices
• De
termine the necessary properties for your protective device. Do you need, for example, one or more elec‐
tro-sensitive protective devices (ESPE), physical guards, movable physical guards or position fixing protective
devices?
• Determine the correct positioning and dimensions for each protective device, in particular the safety distance
(minimum distance) and the necessary protective field size/height for the protective device concerned.
• Integrate the protective devices as stated in the instruction handbook and as necessary for the level of safety.
Logic units
• Choose a suit able lo
gic unit based on the number of safety functions and the logic depth.
• Use certified function blocks and keep your design clear.
• Have the design and the documentation thoroughly checked (principle of counter checking by a second
person).3C – DESIGNING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Subject to change without notice\n3d – Verifying the safety function
During verification, analyses and/or checks are carried out to demonstrate that the safety function meets the
objec
tives and requirements of the specification in all aspects.
Verification essentially involves the following:
• Verification of physical guards
• Verification of functional safety
• Verification of the design of non-physical guards
Verification of physical guards
In the case of physical guards, the design must be checked to ascertain whether the devices meet requirements
wit
h regard to separation or distancing from hazardous points and/or requirements with regard to the restraining
of ejected parts, hazardous substances or radiation. Particular attention should be paid to compliance with
ergonomic requirements.
This is to ensure that the protective device provides the protection that meets the requirements.
Separating and/or distancing effect
• Suff
icient safety distance and dimensioning (reaching over, reaching under, etc.)
• Suitable mesh size or grid spacing for fence elements
• Sufficient rigidity and suitable mounting
• Selection of suitable materials
• Safe setup
• Resistance to aging
• Design of the guard prevents climbing on the guard
Restraining of ejected parts, hazardous substances or radiation
• Suff
icient rigidity, impact resistance, fracture strength (retention)
• Sufficient retention for the prevailing type of radiation, in particular where thermal hazards are concerned
(heat, cold)
• Suitable mesh size or grid spacing for fence elements
• Sufficient rigidity and suitable mounting
• Selection of suitable materials
• Safe setup
• Resistance to aging
Ergonomic requirements
• Suitable t

Verification of functional safety
Machine-specific type-C standards and some type-B standards require a target level for safety functions. There are
tw
o different methods for determining the level of safety achieved:
• Determining the performance level (PL) achieved as per ISO 13849-1
• Determining the safety integrity level achieved (SIL) according to IEC 62061

etermining the achieved Performance Level (PL)
Subsystems
A saf
ety function that is implemented using control measures generally comprises sensor, logic unit, and power
control elements. Such a chain can include discrete elements such as guard interlocking devices or valves, but
also complex safety controllers. Safety functions are therefore often divided into subsystems to reduce complexity.
In practice, pre-certified subsystems are often used for safety functions. PL or PFH D values are provided by the
manufacturer for these subsystems, e.g., for a safety light curtain or a safety controller.
These values apply only for the mission time to be specified by the manufacturer. In addition to the quantifiable
aspects, it is also necessary to verify the measures against systematic failures.

ISO 13849-1 sets out two methods for determining performance level:
• Simplif
ied method  (see "Simplified procedure according to ISO 13849-1", page 131 ): Tabular determination
of performance level based on the performance level of each subsystem
• Detailed method  (see "Detailed procedure according to ISO 13849-1", page 132 ): Calculation of the perform‐
ance level based on the PFH D values of the subsystems. (This method is only described indirectly in the
standard).
More realistic performance levels than those using the simplified method can be determined by applying the
detailed method. For both methods, structural and systematic aspects relating to the achievement of the perform‐
ance level must also be taken into account in addition to the quantitative assessments.

This method also allows the overall PL for many applications to be estimated with sufficient accuracy without
kno
wing individual PFH D values. If the PL of all subsystems is known, the overall PL achieved by a safety function
can be determined using the following table.
This method is based on mean values within the PFH D value ranges for the different PLs. Therefore, using the
detailed method (see next section) may deliver more accurate results.

• Determine the number of subsystems with this PL (low): n (low)
Example 1:
• All sub s
ystems achieve PL “e”, so the lowest PL (low) is “e”.
• The number of subsystems with this PL is 3 (i.e., ≤ 3). Therefore, the overall PL achieved is “e”.
• According to this method, adding another subsystem with a PL of “e” would reduce the overall PL to “d”.3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

• One sub s
ystem achieves PL “d”, two subsystems achieve PL “c”. The lowest PL (low) is, therefore, “c”.
• The number of subsystems with this PL is 2 (i.e. ≤ 2). Therefore, the overall PL achieved is “c”.
This method is based on mean values within the PFH D value ranges for the different PLs. Therefore, using the
detailed method (see next section) may deliver more accurate results.
NOTE
- If t he P
L is not known for all subsystems, their safety level can be determined ( see "Determining the safety level
of a subsystem", page 132 ).
Detailed procedure according to ISO 13849-1
An essential – but not exclusive – criterion for determining the PL is the “probability of a dangerous failure per
hour (P FHD)” of t
he safety components. The resulting PFH D value is the sum of the individual PFH D values.
Determining the safety level of a subsystem
If the P
FHD value is not known for all subsystems, then their safety level can be determined. Subsystems can
consist of several components, even from different manufacturers. Examples of components in subsystems:
• Input side: 2 safety switches on a physical guard
• Output side: 1 contactor and 1 frequency inverter to stop a dangerous movement
For these subsystems with multiple components, the PL must be determined separately.
The performance level achieved for a subsystem is made up of the following parameters:
• Structure and behavior of the safety function under fault conditions ( "Structure and category of safety-related
parts of controllers", page 132 )
• MTTF D values of individual components ( "Mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF D)", page 133 )
• Diagnostic coverage ( "Diagnostic coverage (DC)", page 134 )
• Common cause failure ( "Common cause failure (CCF)", page 135 )
• Software aspects that are relevant to safety
• Systematic failures

Subs
ystems are usually single-channel or dual-channel. Unless additional measures are in place, single-channel
systems respond to errors with a dangerous failure. Errors can be detected by introducing additional testing
components or dual-channel systems supporting reciprocal testing. ISO 13849-1 defines categories for classifying
the structure of subsystems:3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Mean time to dangerous failure (MTTF D)
MT
TF stands for Mean Time To Failure. From the point of view of ISO 13849-1, only dangerous failures need to be
considered (hence the “D” for “dangerous” in MTTF D).
This value represents a theoretical parameter expressing the probability of a dangerous failure of a component
(not the entire subsystem) within the lifetime of that component. The actual lifetime of the subsystem is always
shorter.
The MTTF value can be derived from the failure rates. Where:3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION
8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK S P E C I A L  I N F O R M A T I O N  | Guide for Safe Machinery 133
Subject to change without notice\n• The B 10 v alues apply to electromechanical or pneumatic components. Their maximum lifetime depends on
the wear and the switching frequency. B 10 therefore indicates the number of switching cycles until 10% of the
components fail.
• The B 10D value is concerned with the dangerous failure of components (the “D” in B 10D stands for “danger‐
ous”). The value indicates the number of switching cycles until 10% of the components fail dangerously. If the
B10D value is not specified, it may generally be assumed that: B 10D = 2 × B 10
• The failure rate λ applies to electronic components. Often the failure rate is given in FIT (Failures In Time).
FIT=1 means one failure per 109 hours.
ISO 13849-1 combines the MTTF D values into ranges:
Table 54: Ranges of the MTTF D value according to ISO 13849-1
Designation Range
Low 3 years ≤ MTTF D < 10 y e ars
Medium 10 years ≤ MTTF D < 30 y e ars
High 30 years ≤ MTTF D < 100 y e ars
The mean time to a dangerous failure in years (MTTF D) can be c alculated for the overall system from the
component values.
To avoid overrating the impact of reliability, the useful maximum value for the MTTF D has been limited to
100 years.

Diagnostic coverage (DC)
The le
vel of safety can be increased if fault detection is implemented in the subsystem. The diagnostic coverage
(DC) is a measure of the capability to detect dangerous errors. Poor diagnostics only detect a few errors, good
diagnostics detect a large number of or even all failures.
Instead of a detailed analysis (FMEA), the ISO 13849-1 standard contains various quantified measures. The DC is
divided into various ranges:3D – VERIFYING THE SAFETY FUNCTION

Common cause failure (CCF)
Exter
nal influences (e.g., voltage level, overtemperature) can cause several identical components to become
unusable at the same time, regardless of how infrequently they would otherwise fail or how well they have been
tested. To illustrate this: When the light goes out, you can neither read the newspaper with one eye or with both
eyes because it is dark. Such common cause failures must be prevented.
Annex F of ISO 13849-1 provides a simplified method to evaluate measures taken against CCF. A maximum
number of points is defined for each measure. Suitable points are awarded for each measure that has been
applied. A total score of 65 or higher indicates that adequate CCF measures are in place.

A performance level of “d” can be achieved, for example, using a dual-channel control system (category 3). This
can be achieved either with components of good quality (MTTF D = medium) if almost all errors are detected (DC =
medium) or with components of very good quality (MTTF D = high) if many errors are detected (DC = low).
A complex mathematical model underlies this procedure. To ensure a pragmatic approach, the parameters cate‐

1) Definition of the “power control element” subsystem
The “po
wer control element” subsystem comprises two contactors
with “feedback”. As the contactor contacts are positively guided, a
safety-relevant failure of the contactors can be detected (EDM).
The UE410 logic unit is not itself part of the “power control element”

3) Determination of the MTTF D per c hanne l
As contactors are subject to wear, the B 10D value and the estimated
switching frequency (n op) must be used to calculate the MTTF D. The
following formula applies:
The figure for the switching frequency comprises operating
hours/day [h op], working days/year [d op] as well as the switching
frequency per hour [C]:
General conditions according to the manufacturer:
•B10D = 2,600.000
•C = 1 / h (assumed)
•dop = 220 d/a
•hop = 16 h/d

Alternative: Determining the achieved safety integrity level (SIL)
The achieved safety integrity level (SIL) according to IEC 62061 is determined based on the following criteria:
• The s
afety integrity of the hardware
°Structural restrictions (SIL claim limit)
°Probability of dangerous hardware failures (PFH D)
• The requirements for systematic safety integrity
°Avoidance of failures
°Management of systematic errors
Here – similar to ISO 13849-1 – to determine the PL the safety function is first broken down into function blocks
and then transferred to subsystems.

• The PFH D of the overall control system from the sum of the individual PFH D does not exceed the values in
Figure see figure 109  “Verification of functional safety”.
Example
In the figure above, all subsystems achieve SIL3. The addition of the PFH D value s does not exceed 1 × 10–7. The relevant
measures for systematic safety integrity are in place. Therefore, the safety function achieves SIL3.
Systematic safety integrity
When dif
ferent subsystems are interconnected to create a control system, additional measures for systematic
safety integrity must be taken to avoid systematic errors.
Measures for avoiding systematic hardware errors include, amongst other things, the following:
• Design in accordance with the functional safety plan
• Correct selection, combination, arrangement, assembly, and installation of subsystems, including cabling,
wiring, and other connections
• Use within the manufacturer's specifications
• Compliance with application instructions provided by the manufacturer (catalog data, installation instructions,
and application of proven practical experience, for example)
• Observance of requirements with regard to electrical equipment in accordance with IEC 60204-1
Furthermore, consideration must be given to the control of systematic errors, for example through the following
measures:
• Cutting off the power supply to induce a safe status
• Measures to manage the effects of errors and other effects arising out of a shared data communication
process, including transmission errors, repeats, loss, insertion, incorrect sequence, corruption, delay, etc.

bed above (V model, quality management, etc.), it also includes numerous detailed notes and requirements about
the correct approach when developing software for safety-related systems.
Result - Determining the SIL for the subsystem
Fir
st, the safety integrity of the hardware is determined separately for each subsystem:
If the subsystems are already developed (as is the case with safety light curtains, for example), the manufacturer
of the subsystem will supply the corresponding parameters in the context of the technical specification. A subsys‐
tem of this type is usually described in sufficient detail by the specification of SIL, PFH D, and mission time.
For subsystems consisting of subsystem elements (interlocking devices for protective doors or contactors, for
example), on the other hand, safety integrity must be determined.
SIL claim limit
Once t
he hardware tolerance (architecture) has been specified, the maximum achievable SIL (SIL claim limit) can
be determined for the subsystem.

Example: Determining the SIL and PFH D of the “po wer control elements” subsystem
1) Definition of the “power control elements” subsystem
The “po
wer control elements” subsystem comprises two contactors
with “feedback”. As the contactors are positively guided, a safety-rel‐
evant failure of the contactors can be detected (EDM).
The UE410 logic unit is not itself part of the “power control ele‐
ments” subsystem, but it is used for diagnostics purposes.

3) Determination of the PFH D
a) Ba sed on t
he fault rate λ D
Since contactors are subject to wear, the B 10D value and the esti‐
mated switching frequency must be used to calculate the switching
frequency per hour [C].
It is assumed that the fault rate remains constant during applica‐
tion.
General conditions according to the manufacturer:
•B10D = 2,600.000
•C = 1 / h (assumed)
These boundary conditions result in a λ D of 3.8 × 10–8 1 / h.
b) Based on the CCF factor (β)
Measures to avoid the common cause effect are required in multi-
channel systems. The effect is determined based on measures as
per the requirements of IEC 62061. In the example, the factor is 5%
(see: “5) Evaluation of the measures to avoid common cause errors”

As t
he contacts are positively guided, a “high” DC (99 %) is derived.
In other words, 99 % of dangerous errors λ D for contactors are
detected. Accordingly, the SFF = 30 % + 69.3 % = 99.3 %.

The verification methods described require knowledge and experience of the concepts of performance level (PL)
and saf
ety integrity level (SIL). This knowledge and practical experience is available to you in SICK's service and
training portfolio ( see "How SICK supports you", page 161 ).
The SISTEMA software assistant, which was developed by IFA in Germany and is available free of charge, supports
an effective method for calculating performance level. SICK offers a library of certified safety products for this

Summary: Verifying the safety function
General
• Ver
ify that the intended safety functions conform to the required safety level. To do this, verify mechanical
and functional safety.
Methods
• De
termine the resulting level of safety as per ISO 13849-1 (PL). Available methods:
°Simplified method (based on PL)
°Detailed method (based on PFH D values)
• If neither the PL nor the PFH D value of the subsystem (e.g., the power control element) is known, determine
the safety level of the subsystem from the following aspects: “structure, reliability, diagnostics, resistance,
and process”.
• Alternatively, determine the resulting level of safety as per IEC 62061 (SIL). Here too it is possible to
determine even the safety level of a subsystem that is not certified.

Validation is the checking of a theory, a plan, or a proposed solution in relation to a problem that needs to be
solv
ed. Unlike verification, where only the correct implementation of a solution in accordance with specification is
assessed, validation is about the ultimate assessment of a solution in general terms with regard to its suitability to
reduce risk as required.

The pur
pose of the validation procedure is to check the specification and the conformity of how the components
involved in the safety function have been integrated on the machine. Validation shall show that safety-related parts
of the control function meet the requirements of ISO 13849-2, in particular the requirements for the level of safety
defined.
Insofar as is reasonable, validation should be carried out by persons who were not involved in the design of
the safety-related parts of the control systems. In the validation process, it is important to check errors and in
particular omissions in the formulated specification. The critical part of how a safety-related control function has
been designed is usually the specification.
For example, access to a robot cell is to be safeguarded by a light curtain. The safety function is thus specified as
follows:
“If the protective field of a light curtain is interrupted, all hazardous machine functions shall cease as quickly as
possible.”
However, the designer shall also have considered restarting when the protective field becomes clear again, in
particular if access can be gained to it by standing behind this field. The validation process shall uncover such
aspects. As a rule, a validation process involves the application of a number of procedures that complement each
other.
These include the following procedures:
• Technical inspection of the positioning and effectiveness of protective devices
• Practical inspection of response to failure with regard to the expected results by means of simulations3E – VALIDATING ALL SAFETY FUNCTIONS

The increasing requirements for linking plants and machines of production facilities, and the data exchange via
open int er
faces required for this, opens up the possibility of intentional or an unintentional access to safety
parameters and production-related data. This creates new challenges for information security and must be taken
into account to prevent injury to persons or damage to machines and systems or the environment.
Consequently, this necessitates an overall assessment of machine safety and information security aspects by
component manufacturers, machine manufacturers, system integrators and plant operators. The overall assess‐
ment always starts with defining the limits of the machine (usage limits and spatial limits). The limits also include
communication interfaces relevant to cybersecurity, both between humans and machines, between machines and
the control system, and between machines. A risk assessment or hazard assessment is performed based on
these limits. Based on the risk analysis, all sources of danger are analyzed and appropriate measures taken.
Cybersecurity attacks do not create new hazards in terms of machine safety, but the effectiveness of protective
measures can be negatively impacted or interrupted. For example, the system components associated with a
safety requirement might not stop or speeds might not be reduced to the necessary level, creating hazards.
Cybersecurity considerations are relevant to the following machines:
• Machines with programmable controllers with electronic interfaces
• Machines with programmable controllers with a network connection
Machines with contact-based controls or machines with electronic but non-programmable controllers are not
directly relevant to cybersecurity considerations. If electronically parameterizable components are integrated,
hazards can in turn arise via the interface to the parameterization device.
What measures are necessary to address the cybersecurity aspects of machine safety?
Protective measures familiar from office communications or in the private sphere (firewall, virus scanner) are not
suff
icient for the industrial environment. A systematic approach is necessary. In general, the following applies to all
participants operating in the value chain
• the corporate culture and thus awareness within the company of the issue of cybersecurity must be suffi‐
ciently developed.
• an appropriate safety management system must be installed.
• the relevant knowledge must be up to date.
• the necessary technologies with an appropriate level of IT security must be available.3F – FUNCTIONAL SAFETY AND CYBERSECURITY

General
To r
educe the risks posed by the analyzed hazard, proceed in accordance with the 3-step method:
1 Design the machine so that the risk is eliminated as far as possible.
2 Define, apply, and check the required protective measures.
3 Define how any remaining residual risks can be reduced and provide this information to the user.
Technical protective measure
• Eit
her of the ISO 13849-1 (PL) or IEC 62061 (SIL) standards can provide assistance with regard to functional
safety.
• Define the safety functions and determine the required safety level for each.
• Draft the safety concept. Select the most effective protective devices and how they will be assembled and
integrated into the control system.
• Make sure that the protective measures are implemented effectively and that the required safety level is
achieved.4 – INFORMATION FOR USE

In pr ac
tice, therefore, it may be the case that an individual technical measure does not reduce risk however a
satisfactory result is achieved in the overall context. Sufficient risk reduction can be considered to have been
achieved if all of the following questions can be answered with “yes”:
• Have all operating conditions in all phases of the machine's life cycle been taken into account?
• Was the 3-step method used?
• Have the hazards been dealt with or the risks posed by the hazards minimized to the fullest possible practical
extent?
• Is there an assurance that the measures taken will not result in new hazards?
• Have users been given sufficient information about and warning of the residual risks?
• Is there an assurance that the protective measures that have been taken will not impair the working
conditions of operating personnel?
• Are the protective measures that have been taken compatible with one another?
• Has sufficient consideration been given to the possible consequences of using the machine in a non-com‐
mercial or non-industrial environment?
• Is there an assurance that the measures taken will not unduly impair the function of the machine as

• Clarify the procedure for the machinery or machine components provided in advance.
• Draw up a contract specifying how additional documentation is to be provided (e.g., risk assessment, etc.) so
that it will be easier to make changes downstream.
• Define, as far as possible, the usage of important standards (harmonized standards in the EU) as the basis.
• Agree on a procedure in the event of deviations from harmonized standards.
Safety inspections
Experience shows that in practice, machine safety is not perfect. Protective devices are often manipulated by the
machine oper
ator in order to work without hindrance. Other problems are the incorrect positioning of protective
devices and improper integration into control systems.
The safety state of work equipment and systems in operation is regulated by EU Directive 2009/104 / EC
(“Work Equipment Directive”); it shall be inspected to ensure conformance with applicable national legislation.
In particular, Article 4a of the Directive defines the inspection of work equipment. Technical rules, standards or
certain regulations can serve as a guide as to how the inspection should be carried out. The user of the respective
equipment must perform a risk assessment and is responsible for ensuring that the inspection is carried out and
that occupational safety is ensured.
In so doing, the user shall ensure that work equipment is inspected in accordance with the national transposition
of the Work Equipment Directive to the country of use.
The following requirements must be met:
1 Type of inspection
2 Scope of the inspection
3 Level of detail of the inspection
4 Inspection intervals
5 Level of competence of the inspector
A safety inspection by SICK provides you with a fast overview of the safety status of your machines.
Parts of SICK's sales organization have already been accredited as an inspection body.
Accreditation by an independent body verifies that SICK is capable of carrying out the activities specified in the
accreditation scope with a high level of reliability and quality.
We discuss potential for improvement with you and work in partnership to realize them.🏭 R ESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER

Wor
k Equipment Directive, Article 4a Inspection of work equipment
1 The employer shall ensure that where the safety of work equipment depends on the assembly conditions,
it shall be subject to an initial inspection (after assembly and before first being put into service) and an
inspection after assembly at a new site or in a new location by competent persons within the meaning of
national laws and/or practices, to ensure that the work equipment has been assembled correctly and is
operating properly.
2 The employer shall ensure that work equipment exposed to conditions causing such deterioration is subject
to:
■ Periodic inspections and, where appropriate, testing by competent persons within the meaning of
national laws and/or practices; and
■ Special inspections by competent persons within the meaning of national laws and/or practices each
time that exceptional circumstances which are liable to jeopardize the safety of the work equipment
have occurred, such as modification work, accidents, natural phenomena or prolonged periods of
inactivity, in order to ensure compliance with health and safety regulations and the timely detection and
rectification of resulting damage.
3 The results of inspections shall be recorded and kept at the disposal of the authorities concerned. They must
be retained for a suitable period of time. When work equipment is used outside the undertaking it shall be
accompanied by physical evidence that the last inspection has been carried out.
4 Member States shall determine the conditions under which such inspections are made.
Significant modification of machinery
Machines usually have a service life of several decades. The further development of technologies and the
req
uirements of the market lead to a continuous improvement of machines and production systems. In many
cases, machines are also modified to fit existing production lines and systems. Such modifications may include
features and functions that can have a significant impact on the safety of the machine or production line.
National regulations may impose specific requirements on the modification of existing machinery, while others
are limited to general mandatory clauses for the user (employer). The European Machinery Directive also requires
that significantly modified machinery comply with the essential health and safety requirements. The Machinery
Directive does not clarify, however, what is to be considered a significant modification. The national European
occupational health and safety authorities are given the freedom to define the criteria for a significant modifica‐
tion.
The following methodology was developed jointly by industry and occupational health and safety authorities in
Germany and has been in use since 2010.
General requirements
When a mac
hine is modified, the procedure described in the Methodology section must be performed to deter‐
mine if the modification(s) is (are) significant.
Legal note: Limiting the risk assessment and reduction to the modified parts and/or zones of the machine may not
be sufficient to comply with national legal requirements.
Methodology
The f
ollowing steps must be carried out in the specified order ( see figure 127, page 160 ):
Table 59: Steps of the methodology for evaluating significant modifications in machinery
Step Description
Step 1 Determine if the modifications will result in the occurrence of new hazards. If newly identified
haz
ards result in significant risks, follow Step 3; otherwise, the modifications are considered to be
non-substantial.
Step 2 If no new hazards have been identified and the modifications do not increase any of the existing
ris
ks, the changes are considered non-substantial. If pre-existing risks are increased by the modifi‐
cations, follow Step 3.🏭 R ESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER
158 S P E C I A L  I N F O R M A T I O N  | Guide for Safe Machinery 8007988/2024-10-21 | SICK
Subject to change without notice\nStep Description
Step 3 The modifications are considered not to be significant if the existing risk reduction measures
adeq ua
tely reduce the risks arising from the new hazards (Step 1) or from the increased risks (Step
2). Otherwise, follow Step 4.
Step 4 If the new hazards are eliminated by simple protective devices or by simple integration of additional
pro
tective devices, or if the increased risk is adequately reduced, the modifications are considered
not to be significant. Otherwise, the modification is considered to be significant.
If a modification is considered significant, a risk assessment and risk reduction must be performed in accordance
wit
h ISO 12100:2010, but may be limited to those parts and/or zones affected by the modification.
Simple protective devices are:
• Fixed physical guards or
• Movable physical guards, or non-physical guards that do not significantly interfere with the existing safety-
related control of the machine.
The simple integration of additional protective devices  is limited to those that also do not significantly interfere
with the existing safety-related parts of control systems (SRP/CS) of the machine:
• The signals of the new protective devices are processed in the existing design of the SRP/CS.
• Independent of the existing safety controller, only the safe stop of the dangerous machine function is
affected.
A non-significant modification  is considered to be:
• Replacement of components of a machine by identical components or components with an identical function
and identical safety level.
• Installation of safety devices that result in an increase in the safety level of the machine and do not allow for
advanced features or functions.🏭 R ESPONSIBILITY OF THE USER
